"TIMOB-23816","Bug","Windows",5,"Windows: Unable to build to an 8.1 emulator","h5.Description    *This is a regression from 5.4.0.GA*    When building to a Windows Phone 8.1 emulator the following happens.    * An Windows 10 Mobile emulator is launched  * The build fails with the below, probably because the emulator is a Windows 10 Mobile emulator        *Notes*    When using 5.5.0 and 6.0.0 the device-id for the emulator launched is 8-1-1, in 5.4.0.GA it is 8-1-13. In previous SDKs (and 5.4.0.GA), 8-1-1 was a Windows 10 Mobile emulator which was removed from {{ti info}} output and emulator selection prompts TIMOB-19811, which explains why when selecting that option launches a Windows 10 emulator. I believe this change is the reason for the error outlined above    h5.Steps to reproduce    # Install either the latest 5_5_X or 6_0_X SDK. {{appc ti sdk install -b 5_5_X -d}} or {{appc ti sdk install -b 6_0_X -d}}  # Ensure that the installed SDK above is your selected SDK {{appc ti sdk select <sdk_version>}} and also the SDK in your tiapp.xml  # Build an application using {{appc run -p windows -T wp-emulator}}  # Select an 8.1 emulator in the prompt    h5.Actual result    A Windows 10 Mobile emulator will be launched and the build process will fail with the above error    h5.Expected result    A Windows Phone 8.1 emulator will be launched, build process should not fails"

Currently, if a user uses an API that needs a capability but is not included in the API capability list in the SDK then they will have to add the capability to the tiapp.xml and then figure out all other capabilities they need, an example of this is TIMOB-23832.    To make the development workflow easier we should always generate the capability list even when the tiapp.xml already contains."

"TIMOB-23872","Improvement","Android|Tooling",2,"Enable android.mergeCustomAndroidManifest by default","When the Android build was rewritten for Node.js, a flaw was purposely ported from the old Python code. For iOS, {{<plist>}} overrides a custom {{Info.plist}} and a custom {{Info.plist}} overrides the default {{Info.plst}}. However with Android, if a custom {{AndroidManifest.xml}} is present, the {{<manifest>}} section of the {{tiapp.xml}} does NOT override the custom {{AndroidManifest.xml}} by default. To enable this behavior, you must set {{ti config android.mergeCustomAndroidManifest true}}.    We should set this flag to {{true}} so that Android's behavior is in parity with iOS."

This uses the ""provided"" JSCore engine for Titanium apps. As such, we should be able to use standard iOS tooling to debug the app, like Safari's debugger. However, the way we set up on particular object in the JS world, our code doesn't handle it. Specifically e hang a ""Kroll"" object off the global and ave it wrap a single instance of our KrollContext class in Obj-C. But all our code for handling wrapped JS objects assume it _always_ a KrollObject inside. In tis case, it's a KrollContext. So our Kroll*Property functions in KrollObject need to check for and handle this special object."

"TIMOB-23882","Improvement","Windows",13,"Windows: Allow multiple architectures to be targeted when packaging for Windows 10","h5.Description    When a Windows 10 application in Visual Studio a developer is given the option to select the architectures they wish to package for, with the options of x86, x64 and ARM. The app is then built for all architectures and a universal app bundle is created.    When a developer packages a titanium application for Windows Platform they will only be able to package for one architecture at a time by choosing either {{dist-phonestore}} or {{dist-winstore}}, this means that in order to create a universal app a developer will have to package multiple times each release cycle, and also will not be able to package for x64 architecture.    I propose that we investigate the following possibilities:    * Add a new packaging option, {{dist-universal}}, when packaging for this it will create an appx that includes all architectures.   ** This fits in with the naming scheme of the current options, but is not immediately clear to a user what architectures will be targeted  * Replace the existing {{dist-*}} packaging options with a singular option, and then introduce a flag to allow a user to specify the architectures to be built, either defaulting to all or to prompt the user to select  ** This is a much larger effort that although it provides a better publishing flow the cost probably outweighs the benefit"

This worked well until Titanium SDK 5.1.2.GA, but once we decided to upgrade to 5.4.0.GA we noticed problems with the images. Cause was wrongly set mime type with value (""image/bitmap"") although the actual content in the BLOB is ""image/jpeg"".  We've done some further analysis and actually found the place in the code where this should be corrected. More precisely, if you look at TiBlob.java#blobFromImage() you will see:      You can notice that although compression (PNG/JPEG) might happen the mime type is hardcoded as ""image/bitmap"" which is wrong.

Yet, users could still pinch to zoom and tap within the photo to set the exposure point. With iOS 10, app built with 5.2.2 and allowEditing set to false,  pinch & exposure no longer work.    Migrating to 5.5.x / Xcode 8 and testing the code with that environment with allowEditing=false, pinch & exposure don't work. (NSCameraUsageDescription key is added in tiapp.xml.)    Setting allowEditing=true, users can again pinch to zoom and set exposure, however, they can no longer tap on the buttons in the overlay. It's as if the camera preview is at a higher zIndex .. the overlay is visible however touch events go to the camera not the overlay.    As a result, users are stuck -- they can't tap on the overlay's Done button to close the camera and use the rest of the app. They have to force-quit the app.     h6.

"TIMOB-24034","Bug","iOS|Tooling",5,"iOS: New logging system breaks differential builds - simulator builds only","The iOS Simulator shares ports with the host machine. The iOS build will select a log server port based on the {{<log-server-port>}} in the tiapp.xml or based on the hash of the app id using the following logic:        Because we only allow a possible 50,000 possibilities, the likelihood of a collision is high. In my tests, it's about 5%. The solution to the collisions is to just allow manual override by setting a {{<log-server-port>}} in the tiapp.xml.    The next problem is what if the app id hash port resolves a port number used by another piece of software? Say you have MongoDB installed and it's listening on port 27017. It's entirely possible Titanium will pick 27017.    The current iOS build logic tries to be smart. It starts a Node.js server listening on the selected port and if it can't bind to it, then that means some other app already has bound to the port. It will then select a random port. I knew at design time that random ports will break the differential build system, but figured it would only happen if there was a collision.    Turns out that's not quite accurate. If you build an app for the sim and then rebuild our app while leaving the previous build running in the sim, the iOS build will detect the desired port is not available because the iOS app is currently listening on it. This causes the iOS build to randomly select a port.    The port number gets written to the Xcode project. Since it will generate a new random port every build (as long as the sim and previous build is running), the iOS build detects the Xcode project is different and forces a full rebuild.    We have 5 solutions:    1. Don't select a random port. Just use the port regardless if it's in use. Cons: high chance of port collisions and false positives, the iOS app will fail to bind to it and there will be no logs and no warning.    2. Don't select a random port. If the port is already in use, try connecting to it and see if it's the app we're trying to build and if so, then proceed with the build. If the port is being used by something such as a web server, it will be expecting data, but because the log server clients do not send data, we end up in a stalemate. We would need to add a timeout. Cons: the timeout will pause the build by ~1 second.    3. Allow random ports if the desired port is unavailable. Pass the {{GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS=""TI_LOG_SERVER_PORT=XXXX""}} directly into {{xcodebuild}} instead of baking it into the Xcode project. Cons: you will run in a loop where the build will alternate between the hashed port and a random one, we would need to force {{xcodebuild}} to re-compile using the new port value.    4. Write the port to a file (could be any file) and bundle it with the app. Avoids the Xcode project and {{xcodebuild}}. If the file does not exist or is empty, then logging is disabled. Cons: easy to accidentally ship with the app and enable logging in production.    5. Pass the port number in as an argument when we call {{simctl launch}}. We would still bake the {{DISABLE_TI_LOG_SERVER=1}} into the Xcode project for dist builds. Cons: ioslib currently does not support passing arguments into {{simctl launch}}, subsequent manually launching the app will not have the argument.    I think option 1 and 3 are not too good. Option 2 is not so great. Option 4 is not too bad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm-MrkoJPC8    Thoughts?"

"TIMOB-24142","Bug","iOS|Tooling",5,"iOS: Custom Ti.Facebook entitlements-file overrides CLI-generated entitlements","Ok, so in TIMOB-23908 we fixed the missing APS-environment key in our entitlements file by grabbing the correct keys from the provisioning profiles. And as of TIMOB-23897, we suggested to create a custom entitlements file to add the keychain access to the entitlements.    Unfortunately, those two are concurring, causing the generated entitlements to be overwritten by the own one (which is I guess the intended behavior like we used to do with our Info.plist).     So we need to come up with a solution that a) merged the two files properly or b) generates the {{keychain-access-groups}} key whenever the ti.facebook module is used. I could think of a CLI-hook that is part of the plugin, like we [recently did|https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/MOD-2299] with the appcelerator.encrypteddatabase module."

Problem    Summary: Uploading files larger than appx. 10 MB on older Android devices results in java.lang.OutOfMemoryError either called within httpclient.onerror, or as an uncaught exception viewable in LogCat before upload even starts.    Expected behavior: Being able to upload the attached 50 MB file with no errors. Perhaps it doesn't upload in chunks?    Actual behavior: httpclient.onerror is called with e.error: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError, or uncaught exception, depending on how much RAM device has.      h2. Test findings    I've done a lot of testing to narrow this down.   For simulators I exclusively used intel x86 images.  I've tested exclusively with no apps running in the background.      Here's my findings:      OK: No error - the file is uploaded OK.

Test conclusion    On Android SDK versions below 5, for devices with little RAM, all uploads will fail with out of memory errors.      h2. Possible fix suggestion     Perhaps detect Android versions below 5 when sending large files via httpclient, and upload those files in chunks instead of reading it all to memory.  If httpclient is already using chunked uploads, maybe decrease chunk sizes.      h2.

Both solutions require a core-SDK change, rather than CLI/Hyperloop changes. I would prefer the latter solution, since it's more transparent clear to the developer and easier to extend.

All of these 4 views don't have width or height (so it uses the Ti.UI.FILL as default)    *Rene Pot stackoverflow answer:*    _I have noticed this too with a completely different implementation. I had just one view that I included in a window.    Apparently the left and top calculations were not done properly if the elements is hidden.    What I did to solve the issue is to hardcode the left/top position by calculating the left position using this:    *$.content.left = (Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth - 75) / 2;*    Where in my case 75 is the width the element has, so that'll be bigger in your case. You can do the same for height.    Now, this is an iOS only solution. On Android you will need to take DPI into consideration calculating it.    I do think it is a bug, though this solution works perfectly for me. I recommend looking at JIRA and see if it is a known issue, and if not, raise it with a very specific explanation of the problem, preferably with a reproducible case delivered as an app. Classic would help most. And if it is not reproducible in classic it might be an alloy issue._"

"TIMOB-24391","Bug","iOS",0,"Hyperloop: iOS - Projects containing bitcode-enabled Cocoapods dependencies cause build-failure in Xcode 8.3 Beta","When running an app in Xcode 8.3 Beta, it works fine. But when I include a module that has Bitcode enabled (like Hyperloop and all new modules by default), I get a the following build error:    You can force a Xcode 8.3 build using {{appc run -p ios -I 10.3 --log-level trace}} which will select Xcode 8.3 to build the iOS 10.3 target app. I was able to reproduce this error using the [hyperloop-examples|https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples] app, but not with Ti.Facebook so far - which still needs to investigated.    In general, this is no valid {{Bug}} so far, so it's marked as a {{Story}}. In case it get's validated to be one, here are some possible solutions:  - Enabled Bitcode in the Titanium SDK    - Question: Was there a reason that this wasn't enabled when we enabled it in modules?  - Disable Bitcode in all our code-modules    - Hopefully not, it would be a breaking change    Note: This is *not happening* on Simulator builds. Unfortunately, I didn't see many reports online so far, so it *may* be caused by the Beta version. But we're still in a very early Beta process of Xcode 8.3, so we can investigate this without problems.    *UPDATE 1*: This is also *not happening* with other native modules like ti.facebook. So it may be related to the Hyperloop metabase compiler.  *UDPATE 2*: The build also *works* when including Hyperloop in a new project, so hyperloop-examples seems to be the only effected one so far. Maybe one of the Cocoapods dependencies is causing the issue.  *UPDATE 3*: Tracked it down to the Cocoapods dependencies. Manually disabling bitcode in the Podfile fixes it (as a workaround):  {code:ruby}  post_install do |installer|    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|      target.build_configurations.each do |config|        config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'      end    end  end    post_install do |installer|    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|      target.build_configurations.each do |config|        cflags = config.build_settings['OTHER_CFLAGS'] || ['$(inherited)']        cflags << '-fembed-bitcode'        config.build_settings['OTHER_CFLAGS'] = cflags      end    end  end  {code}  *UPDATE 4*: I was now able to reproduce it with a different project as well, also using Hyperloop. It is attached in the first comment.  *UPDATE 5*: It does *not* fail the build when using a native project using Cocoapods and Bitcode disabled."

Long story short, we would add the compiler flag {{TI_MODULE_VERSION}} to the generated {{module.xcconfig}}, so people can use the flag with {{$(TI_MODULE_VERSION)}}.

This will need some CMake commands like [target_link_libraries|https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.3/command/target_link_libraries.html], [target_include_directories|https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.3/command/target_include_directories.html] and so on.

We might want to add simple commands or something to deal with those common tasks like this.

"TIMOB-24541","Bug","Windows",5,"TextAlign Mishandled on Win Surface on Labels with FILL Width","H5. Issue Description     Labels that have a width of Ti.UI.FILL and a textAlign of either Titanium.UI.TEXT_ALIGNMENT_LEFT or Titanium.UI.TEXT_ALIGNMENT_RIGHT do not appear correctly after opening their containing Window while the Appcelerator app is in split-screen with another application, then expanding the Appcelerator app to full size. Rather than the text moving all the way to the left or right (depending on alignment), it moves most of the way, leaving a sizable gap between the edge of the Label's view and the start or end (depending on alignment) of the Label's text. The width itself appears to be being calculated correctly, which is easily verifiable by adding a backgroundColor to the Label, but the alignment is aligning to the wrong location and appears to be respecting some kind of padding or margin that can't be interacted with. It appears (just from comparing the visual width of the split-screen version and the post-split-screen version) that the text alignment constants may not be being recalculated properly, instead retaining the original left and right limits as defined on the Window's opening. Please see attached screenshots.    This issue does not occur if the Window is loaded in full screen, then reduced down to split-screen, and then returned to full screen.

"TIMOB-24565","Improvement","CLI",3,"iOS CLI: Improve the way dist-appstore build works","First some background. I created [TiFastlane|https://github.com/ulizama/TiFastlane] as a way to be able to use [Fastlane|https://fastlane.tools/] with Titanium development. To be able to use Fastlane when archiving a build it needs to be into an .ipa archive, the way I used to do that is by a small hack, using {{dist-adhoc}} with an App Store profile. This worked until XCode 8.3 in which the Legacy API was disabled.    This puts me in the current situation to which I need some assistance.    The way I'm looking to solve it is to:  # Create the .archive: {{appc run -p ios -T dist-appstore}}  # Use the XCode exporter to export the archive into an ipa {{xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath ""~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2017-04-06/My App 2017-04-06 10-24-57.xcarchive"" -exportPath ""./dist"" -exportOptionsPlist ""./build/iphone/Info.plist""}}    I tested this manually and it works, but there are some issues I'm encountering to be able to have this work as real CLI option.    *Missing method export option in the plist*    The plist generated by the CLI is missing the method, which then has xcodebuild fail when doing the export because it defaults to development so the code signing is wrong. To fix this the correct method needs to be present in the plist:      This issue doesn't happen on 6.0.1.GA, only in the latest version.    *XCode Archiver Launch*    The other issue is that when the {{dist-appstore}} build finishes, it automatically tries to launch the XCode archive manager. This makes it necessary to have an extra human intervention in the step, which breaks the whole automatic process.    It would be great if we could have a way to override that feature, so that when the build finishes it doesn't do anything else.      I'm more than willing to help out in doing changes or tests on the CLI to achieve this, but this is my first time hacking the Ti CLI so I'm a bit lost on what goes where.    Aside from these fixes, it might be worth it to add a {{--export-ipa}} option on the build process so that the CLI automatically does the second step of calling the exporter so we end up with an ipa ready to use for the App Store.

Issue Description    We've been trying to load a ListView in Windows with 500 users (https://randomuser.me/api/?results=500&nat=us) and performance gets quite low when loading 200+ elements in a single ListView (with a custom ItemTemplate).     Here's a little bit of benchmarking we manually did by testing a blank application with only a Window with a ListView on it - App first requests for 500 users and when obtained, it renders them within the ListView and it's really the actual UI rendering which seems to be taking a lot of time, as the server response happens almost immediately after the request.    **Please note ALL of these tests have been performed in an actual Windows device (Surface 3).    100 users - 07.71s, minor blink issue when scrolling down/up (user image to the right disappears and reappears as the rows gain focus)  200 users - 13.35s, major blink issue in the list items when scrolling down/up (they completely disappear and are rendered with a delay)  300 users - 19.91s, same blinking issue as above  400 users - 25.51s, same blinking issue as above  500 users - 32.32s, same blinking issue as above    We'd also like to mention we replicated this (a single Windowed app with only a ListView on it and an HTTP requests that asks for a certain amount of users that will be rendered in the ListView...) and performance looks overwhelmingly better in the native side.    h5.

When set {{false}}, newline {{'\n'}} characters are ignored and the label is put into single-line mode.    This property is unnecessary and should be ignored/deprecated.    *Reason 1:*  If you want newline {{'\n'}} characters to be ignored, then you should remove them from the string yourself before applying them to the label. For example:      *Reason 2:*  If you want to limit a label's text to 1 line, then you should set the ""maxLines"" property to 1. This property is supported on all platforms and will show ellipsis (enabled by default) if the text does not fit within the label. It also honors newlines characters too and would show ellipsis where the line break occurs.      *Reason 3:*  Setting a width on a label implies a wrapping width already, making the ""wordWrap"" property redundant. And if you don't want to word wrap (and honor newlines), then you can set the label's width to {{Ti.UI.SIZE}} (the default setting) and put it into a horizontal {{ScrollView}}.  "

This is because Google's ""TextView.java"" code in its onTouchEvent() method handles URL taps for newer OS versions (see their code on github). So, the recommended solution here is to not set a MovementMethod in ""TiUILabel.java"" and for us to replicate what Google does in their TextView.onTouchEvent() in our TiUILabel code so that we can support URL taps on all Android OS versions."

Basically in the tests we have to skip some tests on a device family because they prompt, Geolocation primarily, currently this is skipped on emulator easily by checking the model but a device is harder to check. We could skip both in one go by doing a check like {{Ti.App.Windows.deviceFamily() === 'Windows.Mobile'}}    There is some demo code on how to do this here https://gist.github.com/wagonli/40d8a31bd0d6f0dd7a5d  but note that it looks the DeviceFamily prop isn't documented https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.system.profile.analyticsinfo      Personally I'm not sure whether this should be in core, maybe in a native module or HL module"

There seems to be an issue when placing a Ti.UI.Button with touchEnabled = false in a separated controller, and instantiating that controller in another whole different one. When doing this, for some reason, the touchEnabled = false property loses its effect.    h5. Steps to Reproduce:  1) Go to Sample project 2's source code and open index.xml - observe how there's only a Window there (mainContainer)  2) In the same project, go to index.js - observe how there's an instance of testController being added to mainContainer  3) In the same project, go to testController.xml - observe its UI structure: only a View (modal) and a Button (touchEnabledFalseButton) within it.  4) In the same project, go to testController.tss - observe touchEnabledFalseButton's style: touchEnabled property is set to false  5) In the same project, go to testController.js - observe the event listener added to touchEnabledFalseButton, which prints the event object in the console.  6) Run this sample project (can be done in a -T ws-local app)  7) A window with a red button on it will be shown  8) Click the red button  9) Observe how the event object gets printed on every click, despite the fact the button has touchEnabled = false on testController.tss  10) ALSO observe how ""Ti.UI.View.enabled property is deprecated. Please use touchEnabled."" gets printed. - Why would this be printed? The project is NOT using the ""enabled"" property ...    h5.

"TIMOB-25240","Improvement","Android",3,"Android: Improve incremental build times","While working on TIMOB-24829 i noticed a few more things in the android build that can be improved, resulting in a faster build time on incremental builds.    Compared to the iOS build, which only takes ~5s for incremental builds, the Android build is much slower with ~30-40 sek. Most of the time is spend on recompiling and dexer operations, which are unnecessary if nothing related changed.    The Android builder already contains a lot of comments about what can be skipped or cached, but contains no actual code that would do that. The actions in particular are:    - Compile java classes (only needs to be done when files in {{build/android/src}} or {{build/android/gen}} change  - Run Proguard (only needs to be done when any java classes changed)  - Run dexer (only needs to be done if any libraries changed, any files in {{build/android/bin/classes}} have changed or debugging/profiling was toggled. This alone will cut down the android build time by approximately one third.    \\  ----  *Final Result:*  Below are the performance improvements between Titanium 8.3.0 and 9.0.0 with [kitchensink-v2|https://github.com/appcelerator/kitchensink-v2] on a 15"" MacBook Pro 2015 with a solid state drive.

"TIMOB-25266","Bug","Android",3,"Android: Loading url in WebView crashes on Android 4.1","*Summary:*  WebView will crash on Android 4.1 when it attempts to load a webpage.    *Test:*        *Notes:*    - It does not crash on Android 4.2 or newer OS versions.  - It won't crash on Android 4.1 if a webpage has not been loaded. (That is, the ""url"" has not been set.)    *Cause:*    It crashes when the Canvas.drawPath() methods get called in our ""TiBorderWrapperView.java"" while hardware acceleration is enabled. So, even though we've never applied a border in the above test code, our WebViewProxy always applies a zero border width to its settings, which is enough to trigger our TiUIView code to go wrap the WebView in a TiBorderWrapperView container.    *Suggested Solution:*  Never draw a border around a WebView on Android 4.1 to work-around this issue.

Given that we now support implicit hooks in a module from TIMOB-24041, we should move straight to simple hooks and deprecate the plugin. To avoid a breaking change we can add a plugin whose hook simply spits out the deprecation notice that the plugin should no longer be added to the tiapp.xml.

Try to scroll down quickly the listview as fast as possible. Click the LV BUTTON to change the contents of the listview (SO as to trigger GC).  3. Still you see no crashes occurring? Cool, background the app for sometimes, open a a memory extensive app like a browser, load some heavy images, and before the system could terminate our backgrounded app,  quickly bring up the app to foreground and do a rapid scroll.  4.

"TIMOB-25377","Bug","Android",5,"Android: ScrollView child percent size should be relative to container size","*Summary:*  On Android, child views that use percent values for their size/positional properties (ex: width, height, top, bottom, etc.) are relative to the size of the scrollable content area when they should be relative to the ScrollView container instead, like iOS.    The main issue with this is that as the content area grows in size (say vertically as you add more views), the percentage based properties such as ""height"" grow as well. This makes it difficult for developers to display child views that 100% fill the ScrollView container to create their own paginated like view.    *Steps to Reproduce:*    # Run the below code on Android.  # Verify that the green ""50%"" view fills half the window vertically.  # Scroll all the way to the bottom.  # Verify that the blue ""100%"" view completely fills the window.    *Test Code:*          "

The same happens when we load the Flurry Pod - except in that case there are no source .m files, just a .a library file and it doesn't seem to recognize any classes at all.    My colleague also believes that having hyphens in the names may be having an impact in the case of the Flurry SDK.

"TIMOB-25522","Improvement","iOS",8,"iOS: Expose navigation-window instance property to Ti.UI.Window","In a production app, there are many cases where the developer would like to know the navigation-window context he/she is currently in. For example, when going through a set of windows to select a configuration, the developer calls ""openWindow(nextWindow)) to open the next window (""push it"") into the current context.    Right now, developers either store a global reference, e.g.   {code:js}  Alloy.Globals.navWindow = nav;    -> [BAD]    I am proposing a solution where the developer can reference the current navigation-window using the ""navigationWindow"" instance property. See the following test-case for an example:  {code:js}  var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({      backgroundColor: '#fff'  });    var nav = Ti.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow({    window: win  });    var btn = Ti.UI.createButton({      title: 'Open next window'  });    btn.addEventListener('click', function() {      win.navigationWindow.openWindow(Ti.UI.createWindow({        title: 'Next Window!',        backgroundColor: 'green'      }));  });    win.add(btn);  nav.open();  {code}  While the developer could still just use the ""nav"" property, it will get more complex when using a multi-level application which scope changes during the navigation-flow. Ideally, once we move the navigation-window to the universal {{Ti.UI.NavigationWindow}} namespace, we could expose the same for Android (cc [~jquick]) and Windows (cc [~kiguchi]).

"TIMOB-25552","Bug","Android",1,"Android: Nested scrolling within disabled ScrollView are not propagated to parent","*Summary:*  When scrolling a child view within a ScrollView, once you reach the top or bottom of the child view, the drag event is supposed to scroll the parent ScrollView. And if the parent ScrollView reaches its top or bottom, then it's drag event is supposed to be propagated to the ScrollView's parent, in case there is a ScrollView within a ScrollView. This works fine unless the inner ScrollView's ""scrollingDisabled"" is set false, in which case, the nested drag event is no longer bubbled up the UI tree.    *Steps to reproduce:*    # Build and run the below code on an Android device.  # Scroll one of the TextArea fields up and down past the bounds of its scrollable area.        *Result:*  The outer ScrollView does not scroll when you reach the top or bottom bounds of TextArea's scroll area.

"TIMOB-25597","Bug","Android",8,"Android: Multidexed apps crash on startup on Android 4.x","*Summary:*  When adding several heavy weight Android modules such as ""ti.map"" and its ""ti.playservices"" dependency, the app will most likely crash on startup on Android 4.x. This is not an issue on Android 5.0 and above since those OS versions have built-in support for multidexed apps.    *Steps to Reproduce:*  # Open the ""tiapp.xml"" file.  # Target Titanium SDK ""7.0.0"" or higher.  # Add module ""ti.map"".  # Add the below property to the ""tiapp.xml"" file. (This will increase the likeliness of the bug.)  # Build and run on an Android 4.x device. (The ""app.js"" code does not matter.)        *Result:*  Crashes on app startup with the following logged error...        *Expected Result:*  Should not crash. (We've added the Google multidex support library with the intention of multidex support on Android 4.x.)    *Reason:*  Android 4.x does not have built-in multidex support. So, we have to add support by calling the Google support library's ""MultiDex.install()"" from the application class which we're already doing now. But in order to do this, Titanium's application class and all of the classes it uses must be embedded in the main dex file or else the Java runtime will fail to lazy load them on startup. We must specify which Java classes must be embedded in the main dex file by using the ""--main-dex-list"" command line argument when building a multidexed app.    *Notes:*  This issue is more likely to happen with Titanium 7.0.0 when using any module that uses Google Play Services. This is because our new ""ti.playservices"" includes a much higher public API count that'll trigger multidexed builds.
