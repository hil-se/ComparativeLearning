"DNN-9466","Bug","Modules - Core",1,"Security: ""DNN Security HotFix 1"" reports false positive warning for text-only Register page","I just applied the ""DNN Security HotFix 1"" patch to three DNN sites. In Host > ""DNN Security HotFix 1"", two of them reported ""WARNING: YOU MAY NOT BE PATCHED."" I traced the problem down to the fact that the two problem sites had Admin > Site Settings > Advanced Settings > Registration Page set to a page named ""Register"". The page was a text-only page explaining our ""no registration policy"". It had absolutely NO third party registration module on the page. So in this case, I believe the warning message was a ""false positive"" and should be fixed.     If you can't eliminate the warning, then at least adding some text to check your ""Registration Page"" setting would have been much appreciated and saved me time investigating other modules.    The work-around is to set the ""Registration Page"" to ""<None Specified>"" and then Host > ""DNN Security HotFix 1"" reports ""You are patched.""    Otherwise, the patch went smoothly. Thanks!"

I tried changing the UserMode (profile) in the database to VIEW, and that works. But once I enter edit mode again, I have the same problem.     I thought maybe there is some CSS that's hiding the editBar, but when I inspected the DOM, the editbar elements were not there at all.

"DNN-10245","Bug","Admin - User Accounts",1,"Updating user profile as admin not working","Hello,    After updating from DNN 7.4.2 toward DNN 9.1.1 we are having problems updating user profiles.

Please note that the error only occurs when updating a user that does not have certain properties created in the database (inside [dbo].[UserProfile]).   For example the Biography property is not there for most of our users.   This probably explains the null reference error, because there is no biography property even though DNN tries to process it (ProfileController.cs @ DNN Platform\Library\Entities\Profile).                             else if (propertyName.Equals(UserProfile.USERPROFILE_Biography, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase))                          {                              propertyValue = RemoveUnsafeAttributes(propertyValue);                          }    I think it should check whether the property value is null or empty? It seems like this was implemented in DNN7. When users update their profile directly via the profile edit screen from DNN, everything works as expected.    Regards,    Frank  "

That works fine for the group you've selected. But as soon as you try to view a list of members of any other group you get a list of members for the group you initially configured because thats the group reference that is stored as [FilterValue] in [ModuleSettings] table.    OK, I won't go into an argument that there is supposed to be logic to look for query string parameter [groupid] which then used to filter out users because that is true. But there lies our problem.    MemberDirectoryController.cs line 126      Can someone correct this function so I won't have to recompile this module every time.     All that needs to be adjusted is an argument for <int filterRoleId> from <Int32.Parse(filterValue)> to <groupId> in the call to <UserController.Instance.GetUsersAdvancedSearch()> and everyone becomes happy.

"DNN-10723","Improvement","Messaging",2,"SI: Messaging Dispatch: Pass Portal Admin's Display Name along with email address","Currently whenever a message/notification is sent through the messaging dispatch, the from address is only composed of the portal e-mail address, while the sender address is a mix of the ""Display Name"" of the user who triggered the notification/message + the portal e-mail address.     This results on some confusing names for e-mails coming from the website since password resets and other tasks will have the Portal administrator's display name + portal's email in the from address so the proper name is displayed on the headers; while on the other e-mails only the e-mail address for the Portal is displayed.    To reproduce:    1. Request a password reset and look at the e-mail headers. From / Sender - both of these will have name + e-mail.    2. Trigger a notification message and review the headers. From only has the e-mail, while sender has both the name + e-mail."
