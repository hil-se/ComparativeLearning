This is a known bug, detailed here: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=254336&tstart=0. A work-around is noted in the link that has been tested to work and allow ImageMagick to install.  Ideally this issue will be fixed by Amazon with the introduction of a new EMR AMI, but if this is not the case by shortly before release time, the work-around should be employed."""
