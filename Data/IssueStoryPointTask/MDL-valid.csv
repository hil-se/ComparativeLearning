"MDL-46777","Improvement","Gradebook|Usability",5,"Improve behaviour of grader header, footer and sidebar on iOS 8 + IE","""This issue relates to jankiness of the grader report on IE and iOS 8 Beta 4 (Safari).    In iOS versions < 8, the scroll event is only fired at the end of the action, and not throughout so this is not an issue.  From iOS 8 (tested with beta 4 on Safari), the scroll event is fired throughout. However, it is not fired frequently enough, resulting in a stuttering feeling.    IE just sucks at tables and with a large table in the DOM, it stutters without any javascript at all. Adding the floating headers makes this more apparent for the same reason that iOS 8 appears to stutter - the scroll event is not called frequently enough, and it looks like it's stuttering as a result.    We've tried several fixes for this already, and at present the code is highly optimised so that the fewest number of calculations occurs. The code also batches UI changes to reduce layout thrashing.    In one sense, it would be nice to use a position of fixed, but this has it's own issues too:  * iOS has a long-standing known issue where fixed items gradually disappear off the screen.    As far as I can tell, there is no known fix for the iOS fixed issue, so to keep it from disappearing off screen, we would have to maintain the current solution of relative positioned elements.

The same applies to templates, when the template is hidden it can not be selected to create a plan from that template.    There is no security risks attached to this issue, which means that the functions listing the frameworks and templates use an optional argument to filter out the invisible template/frameworks. Everyone can list hidden frameworks/templates but the UI will only display the relevant ones (visible). Crafting a request will report the hidden frameworks/templates, and that's fine.    However, the methods that are linking competencies to a framework/template should first check that the competency is not part of a hidden framework, in which case it cannot be linked. The method creating a plan from a template will perform the same check to ensure that the template is visible.    Note that if a framework/template is hidden after the competency/plan was created nothing happens. The hidden option is just there to act as a draft/archived flag to only display the relevant options in the UI. If the competency/plan was already created then it remains visible regardless of the status of its origin.    At a later stage we may decide to rename _visible_ to something more relevant. Or to have a _status_ on the framework/template (draft, active, archived). In that case a framework/template would have to be made """"Active"""" to be visible in the relevant UI, and it could not be sent back as draft when used. Later maybe."""

Also the evidence ->to_record() data should be attached as a _record snapshot_. Same goes with the user_competency if we have it.

"MDL-53211","Task","Competencies",3,"Create a user_competency_course model and populate it on suggest","""It has occurred that we need to store the suggestions that were applied in a course. Simply relying on the _evidence_ will make it hard to compute data for that course only, join, etc... so we will introduce a new model _user_competency_course_ which stores the proficiency and rating of a user in the context of a course.    So, when a teacher is suggesting a rate from a course we will populate the table _user_competency_course_ and attach an evidence as we are currently doing. When a suggestion happens within an activity (e.g. triggered by auto completion) we will also record that at the course level. When the suggestion is in a context parent to a course we proceed as normal.    MDL-52979 will take care of displaying the information in the views.    At a later stage we may decide to rephrase """"Suggest"""" if another word works better."""

"MDL-54751","Bug","Administration|Course|Usability",5,"Recycle Bin - deleting large complex objects forces user to wait","""With the recycle bin enabled, deleting large, complex objects forces the user to wait until the backup process has completed before they can do anything else. When you delete small objects (e.g., labels, simple pages), the deletion occurs quickly. By """"deletion,"""" I mean this workflow:    1.  Turn editing on  2.  Delete item  3.  Turn editing off    But when you delete a larger, complex object, step 3 above -- turning editing off -- can take a long time ( up to > 2 minutes), and there is no indication (other than what the browser provides) that something is happening. You basically have to wait for it to finish. Something that used to happen immediately -- turning editing off after deleting something (regardless of its complexity) -- can take minutes with the Recycle Bin enabled. An example of a """"large, complex object"""" is a quiz with 95 questions and 155 student responses. Obviously, Moodle is working on backing up the quiz, and since it's rather complex (lots of responses), it takes time. The same thing happens on restore. Restoring this kind of quiz can take some time, but there isn't any kind of progress indicator to let the user know that something is happening and that it may take some time.    The concern here is that with the recycle bin enabled, a fundamental aspect of the Moodle experience has changed; i.e., deleting some objects no longer happens quickly if they are complex. How long it takes for Moodle to return control when turning editing back off after deleting an object depends on how large/complex that object is. And Moodle provides no progress indicator that something is happening.    We also saw this behavior when testing the recycle bin plugin our Moodle 2.7 site (we also saw session lock errors for large object deletions). We also see this issue on a test Moodle 3.1 server with the recycle bin enabled. While this quiz example may represent an outlier, users delete all sort of things... small and large objects."""

"MDL-54847","Bug","HTML Editor (Atto)|HTML Editor (TinyMCE)|Media",3,"HTML audio tag removed from forum post","""A user wishes to embed a .wav file into a forum post.  Adding the .wav file via the text editor's media button only inserts a hyperlink to the file (see MDL-54846).  Using the text editor's source mode, the user attempts to embed the uploaded .wav file using the HTML 5 audio tag.  However, upon saving, the audio tag is automatically removed so the file is not embedded.  Using the same code in a page resource, the audio tag is not removed.     *STEPS TO REPLICATE*       1. Create a forum activity.   2. Add a new post to the forum.   3. Click the Media button on the text editor.   4. Upload a .wav file and then click the insert media button.  The .wav file is added to the page as a hyperlink.   5. Click the HTML button on the text editor to switch into source mode.   6. Update the HTML using the HTML 5 audio tag to embed the .wav file into the page.  Same code:     7. Submit the post.   8. Read the post.  Also edit the post and click the HTML button on the text editor.     OBSERVED BEHAVIOR:   The .wav file is not embedded in the HTML.  The audio tag has been removed.  The resulting HTML:       EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:   The audio tag is retained in the HTML.  The .wav file is embedded into the forum post allowing the audio file to be played directly from the post.     *REPLICATION LOCATIONS*   Behavior has been replicated in 3.0.4 and 2.9.3.    *ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION NOTES*    1. The audio tag is removed from the forum post HTML regardless of the file type being embedded.  For example, attempting to embed an .mp3 file with the audio tag also results in the audio tag being removed.   2. Behavior was replicated with both the Atto and TinyMCE text editors.     *USER IMPACT*   An instructor teaching a sound design course would like for students to be able to share their .wav files within forums.  The .wav file format is not among the file formats currently handled by Moodle's media embedding features (see MDL-54846).  A potential work-around would be manually entered the necessary HTML to embed the file, but this cannot be done when the audio tag is automatically removed."""
