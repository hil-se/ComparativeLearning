"APSTUD-4968","Bug","Source Control",8,"GIT Integration only uses first line of a multi-line commit message","I have an issue where, on some projects, when I do a GIT commit with a multi-line commit message, only the first line of the message is used.    The issue is demonstrated in the screencast I put together at http://youtu.be/5AJHkgKRrzk    I've updated to the latest Aptana Studio (v3.1.3) and that hasn't fixed it. (I was previously running v3.0.4)    I'm not sure if Aptana has built-in GIT so I also updated GIT for Windows to the latest 1.7.11-preview (was previously running v1.7.7). This also had no effect.    I've also got msysgit installed, I've upgraded that from 1.7.7 to 1.7.11 too.     As far as I know, this hasn't always been an issue. Though I may be wrong.  It now seems to be affecting all of my projects.    I've got a pretty standard, stand-alone Aptana Studio install - I've not added any plugins or extra modules to it.  And I use it in pretty basic ways to code using PHP.    The only things that may be unusual:   - I don't keep projects in my workspace folder, they're dotted all around my disk.   - I recently installed Eclipse as well - this seemed to be a fairly standalone thing that just popped a load of files in a directory. Is it possible that that's interfered with Aptana?  I don't know when this issue started, so it's hard to say if it started when I installed Eclipse.    I'm not sure what else you'll need to diagnose this. Let me know if you need any configs or .project files or anything.    Thanks    Ross Wintle"

"APSTUD-4974","Improvement","PyDev",20,"Interactive Console does not respect user keybindings","Eclipse allows you to set up your own keybindings for various contexts within the IDE, including the console. However, it appears that the PyDev interactive console doesn't respect these keybindings. It would be nice if the interactive console used Eclipse's commands API to make use of the user's keybindings for text editing (e.g. go to line start/end, etc.).    For example, I use keybindings based on Emacs.  So I can use Ctrl-A to jump to the start of a line, Ctrl+E to jump to the end of a line etc.  It would be really, really wonderful if these key bindings could also be activated for the interactive console, and the debugging console.

"APSTUD-4978","Bug","Content Assist|Editor|Outline|Parsing|PHP",8,"Can't Open Declaration for some Variables, Constants or/and functions/classes/methods in a PHP file","I discovered a bug in the Code-Assist, and 'Open declaration' feature.    The bug make the opening of Declaration places for 'constant, variables, classes, methods, functions' impossible to found (even if the FILE which contains the declaration is already opened in the Aptana Studio 3 Editor!).    So, sometimes.. It cannot open declaration (not always, but sometimes), I cannot tell you how reproduce that bug, but, it's certainly reproductible.    For example, imagine that piece of php code, file is saved to the disk in a project:        Now..    Try to select a php constant used in a php code line as for example *TABLE_PRODUCTS_TO_DISCOUNT_CATEGORIES* and then click with right button and select 'Open Declaration', an error is reported showing in red: {color:red}Current text selection cannot be opened in an editor{color}.    It's not normal I think, since in olds versions of Aptana Studio 3.0.x this thing 'Open Declaration' opened my 'define' line. (and if the define was in other file, then Aptana just open the file and outline the define line! In Aptana Studio 3.2.x it just not effect, and if effect.. just report and error as showned up!).    Is it a bug or a normal new comportment? (can I revert to the old comportment?).    "

"APSTUD-4995","Bug","PyDev",8,"Code-formatting in PyDev may take place even with syntax error, yielding wrong results","Having the code below (which has a syntax error), should not be code-formatted, but it ends up being code-formatted, which yields wrong results.          To properly fix this, the PyDev parser should have a 'faster' way of operating, which means doing only syntax parsing without generating an actual tree (as the code-formatter is currently text-based and not AST-based) just to get syntax errors.    This is especially troublesome when code-formatting on save is used."

"APSTUD-7286","Improvement","Editor|Performance",13,"Implement LRUCache with virtual memory paging scheme in editor infrastructure","Initially the main issue found is that the caching does not really work well with our multi-parsing strategy.    When a parse for a large document is done, say, an html with 30 css and 10 js partitions, each of those will end up requesting a new parse and as our parse cache is an LRU of size = 3, the cache is never used in this situation.    On the good side, once we get caches in place properly, when parsing a large document, we may have lots of sub-partitions already cached, which should make the parsing faster when reparsing the full html.    Ideas on approaches:    1. A simple approach is simply making the cache larger (say 256), but maybe we should have 2 different caches, one for 'outer' calls and another for 'internal' calls inside the parsing structure, but memory may be a problem here.    2. Or maybe a single cache where we have an LRU with a 'desired' max size but items are only prunned if not accessed for some time (say 10 seconds).    3. Having a SoftHashMap may be a reasonable replacement too.    4. Making proper use of the LRUCache implementation we have which implements a virtual memory paging scheme (each value may have an associated size and the LRU has a size related to that - the parsed document length may be a good tradeof in speed/size of the final generated AST).    Selected approach:    LRUCache with virtual memory paging scheme + SoftHashMap for pruned entries (which may be restored if still alive)."

"APSTUD-7662","Bug","HTML|Preview",3,"Aptana Studio 3 crashes on attempted preview/render","h3. Steps to Reproduce Have tested and retested what is causing this: The addition of a textarea element to a HTML file. File has previously been successfully previewed many times. Tested adding the textarea with a combination (none, all, some) of the rows, cols and name attributes just in case it was expecting something that wasn't there: no difference. The inclusion of the textarea element causes Aptana to crash on preview attempt. While I wasn't able to include a screenshot I did attach the various error logs I could assemble: aptana diagnostic, aptana log file (cleared then reproduced error) and system error report on crash (Mac OS X 10.6.8)   h3.

"APSTUD-8264","Bug","Project",5,"After upgrade to 3.6 switching workspaces requires forcequit","This has happened every time I needed to switch workspaces. Aptana closes like usual, but never opens up the new workspace. In fact, related perhaps, Aptana does not actually close when I quit either.    The only way I can use Aptana again is by force closing through the Mac OS force close interface. It will then open and ask my which workspace I want.    I have about 6 workspaces I switch between frequently. Prior to the upgrade I did not have any problems switching spaces.    Also noticed that the ""connections"" node is missing as is the App Explorer tab.    Developing js, html, css and php (no python, no mobile apps, no mysql).
