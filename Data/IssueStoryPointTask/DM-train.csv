Here is an example of query reqult returned from mysql:  and this is the same query processed by qserv:   We discussed this already with Daniel yesterday and at qserv meeting today, here I just want to collect what we know so far so that we can return to this again later.   As Daniel explained to me this is the result of the new parser assigning aliases to the columns which do not define aliases for themselves. This helps with tracking query proceeding through the processing pipeline. Daniel's observation is that different database engines may assign different names to result columns (or some may not even assign any names), there is no standard in that respect so there is no point in trying to follow what one particular implementation does. Additionally there are issues with conflicting column names and names which are complex expressions.  Difference in column names breaks our tests which dump complete results including table header. The tests could be fixed easily, we could just ignore table headers when dumping the data. More interesting issue is that there may be use cases for better compatibility between mysql and qserv including result column naming. In particular standard Python mysql interface allows one to use column names to retrieve values from queiry result. If qserv assigns arbitrary aliases to the columns it may confuse this kind of clients.  This issue depends very much on what kind of API qserv is going to provide to clients. If mysql (wire-level) protocol is going to be the main API (which would allow all kinds of mysql clients to talk to qserv directly) then we should probably think more about compatibility with mysql. OTOH if we decide to provide our own API then this may not be an issue at all (but we still need to fix current test setup which is based on mysql).  We probably should discuss API question at our dev meeting."""

We need to understand exactly which classes will need to make use of Dcr information, and what the limitations are of operating at the per-pixel level (e.g. blends)."""
"DM-590","Story","afw",1,"load non-LSST FITS tables as version 1","""In DM-384 and DM-242, we disabled the periods-to-underscores translations for new tables (""""version 1"""") but left it in place for old tables (""""version 0"""").  In addition, when reading a table without a version number, we assumed it was version 0, to maintain backwards compatibility.  I think we should modify this slightly: we should assume a table without a version number is version 0 if and only if it also has the AFW_TYPE key.  Otherwise we should assume it is version 1.  This will allow us to load externally-produced tables without turning any underscores they contain into periods, while still maintaining backwards compatibility with older tables written by afw."""

It seems that people don't always know that they have been assigned to review a ticket. Also, even if I know I have been assigned to review a ticket, I find it hard to find on JIRA.  More concretely, I would like to see these improvements: - Much clearer notification that one has been assigned as a reviewer. Presently the email is quite generic and easy to miss. In fact I find that most JIRA notifications are rather hard to read -- it's not always easy to see what has changed and thus why I should care.

"DM-737","Story","Qserv",8,"Rendering an IR node tree should produce properly parenthesized output","""It appears that rendering a tree of IR nodes doesn't always result in correct generation of parentheses. Consider the following tree: {panel} * OrTerm ** BoolFactor *** NullPredicate **** ValueExpr ***** ValueFactor: ColumnRef(""""refObjectId"""") ** BoolFactor *** CompPredicate **** ValueExpr ***** ValueFactor: ColumnRef(""""flags"""") **** Token(""""<>"""") **** ValueExpr ***** ValueFactor: Const(""""2"""") {panel}  which corresponds to the SQL for: """"refObjectId IS NULL OR flags<>2"""". If one prepends this (via {{WhereClause.prependAndTerm()}}) to the {{WhereClause}} obtained by parsing """"... WHERE foo!=bar AND baz<3.14159;"""" and renders the result using {{QueryTemplate}}, one obtains:      {{... WHERE refObjectId IS NULL OR flags<>2 AND foo!=bar AND baz<3.14159}}  This is equivalent to      {{... WHERE refObjectId IS NULL OR (flags<>2 AND foo!=bar AND baz<3.14159)}}  which doesn't match the parse tree - one should obtain:      {{... WHERE (refObjectId IS NULL OR flags<>2) AND foo!=bar AND baz<3.14159}}  This issue involves surveying all IR node classes and making sure that they render parentheses properly. {color:gray}(One way we might test for this is to parse queries containing parenthesized expressions where removal of the parentheses changes the meaning of the query. This would give us some IR that we can render to a string and reparse back into IR. If the rendering logic is correct, one should obtain identical IR trees).{color} Other possibilities that might explain the behavior above is that the input tree is somehow invalid or that {{WhereClause.prependAndTerm}} creates invalid IR."""

Here is the summary:  Advantages of IPAC Table format  - Simple and human-readable, contains a single table - Fixed length rows (easy to page through) - Supported by many astronomical tools  - Provides a way to pass data type, units, and null values in the header - More metadata can be added through keywords (attributes)  Disadvantages of IPAC table format   - Steaming can not be started before all data are received – need to know column width before the table can be written (csv is better alternative) - Only alpha-numeric and '_' characters are allowed in column names (small subset of available characters) - Only predefined datatypes and one attribute type (string) - ASCII representation requires about twice as much storage to represent floating-point number data than the binary equivalent.  Advantages of HDF5  - Can represent complex data and metadata (according to LOFAR, good to represent time series) - Structured data, arbitrary attribute types, datatypes can be combined to create structured datatypes - Flexible datatypes: can be enumerations, bit strings, pointers, composite datatypes, custom atomic datatypes - Access time and storage space optimizations - Partial I/O: “Chunked” data for faster access - Supports parallel I/O (reading and writing) - Built-in compression (GNU zlib, but can be replaced with others) - Existing inspection and visualization tools (HDFView, MATLAB, etc.)  Disadvantages of HDF5  - Complex - Tuned to do efficient I/O and storage for """"big"""" data (hundreds of megabytes and more), not efficient for small reads/writes. - Requires native libraries (available in prepackaged jars, see below) - Not human readable - (?) Not yet widely supported by astronomical tools (counter-examples: AstroPy, IDL, more at hdfgroup site)  Tools and Java wrappers:  * JHI5 - the low level JNI wrappers: very flexible, but also quite tedious to use. * Java HDF object package - a high-level interface based on JHI5. * HDFView - a Java-based viewer application based on the Java HDF object package.  * JHDF5 - a high-level interface building on the JHI5 layer which provides most of the functionality of HDF5 to Java. The API has a shallow learning curve and hides most of the house-keeping work from the developer. You can run the Java HDF object package (and HDFView) on the JHI5 interface that is part of JHDF5, so the two APIs can co-exist within one Java program. (from StackOverflow answer, 2012)  * NetCDF-Java is a Pure Java Library, that reads HDF5. However, it's hard to keep pure java version up-to-date with the standard, does not support all the features.  A way to set up native libraries (3rd option from JHDF5 FAQ):      """"Use a library packaged in a jar file and provided as a resource (by putting the jar file on the class path).

Short version:  Clarify what existing community practices, notably including VO interfaces, appear to rely on the availability of unauthenticated access to information in astronomical archives.  h4. Details:  At the February DM All Hands, [~frossie] raised an objection when it was mentioned that there is a presumption that all user access to LSST data through the DM interfaces (as opposed to through EPO) will be authenticated.  We don't appear to have ever documented an explicit requirement that all access be authenticated.  The basic controlling requirement is OSS-REQ-0176, """"The LSST Data Management System shall provide open access to all LSST Level 1 and Level 2 Data Products, as defined in the LSST System Requirements and herein, in accordance with LSSTC Board approved policies. ..."""", which was a carefully crafted indirection at a time when the policy for non-US/Chile access was still being developed.  However, this presumption has been around for a long time.  It is inherent to the project policy that access to the non-Alert data will be limited to individuals who are entitled to it.  No matter what we think the final policy might be, we do have to design a system that can be consistent with this policy.  [~frossie] stated that the astronomical community relies on certain types of data and metadata - she mentioned coverage maps, among others - being available through unauthenticated interfaces.  This ticket is to ask her (and others) to collect documentation of those existing practices, so that we can figure out what the expectations may be and how to respond to them in our design."""

This PLplot change occurred in version 5.9.10 released in 2013. I assume upstream PSFEX has a fix for this.    Given that LSST does not need the PLplot functionality I think the simplest fix may well be to disable the test for PLplot in our version.

Since we can currently only publish packages from master, this means that our lsst fork of xrootd cannot be a """"pure"""" fork -- we end up merging/rebasing from an upstream branch, then force-pushing the downstream master.  Upstream and downstream xrootd repos thus have completely different branch topologies, labels, etc., and history of master in the lsst fork is being continually rewritten to carry local patches forward.  The processes of both adopting upstream changes into the lsst fork and the pushing lsst changes back upstream are cumbersome, confusing, and labor intensive.    It is proposed that we extend our tools to allow publishing components from branches other than master.  This would allow us to have xrootd for example be a """"pure"""" fork of upstream -- we could then create our own branch based off any upstream branch, carry our downstream patches there, and release off of that.    This functionality could be used similarly for any of our current """"t&p"""" components where it would be convenient to track the upstream repo directly and/or carry changes in git instead of in an agglomerated patch file (e.g. when we might want to update frequently and/or contribute general purpose changes back upstream regularly with pr's, etc.)"""

The problem is that astrometry is called twice in {{CalibrateTask}}:   - Just before PSF estimation, in order to get matches to support {{CatalogStarSelector}}.  This call is passed {{sources1}}, a catalog containing only the initial, pre-PSF measurements.   - After the second measurement stage, to determine the {{Wcs}} and get matches to feed {{PhotoCal}}. This call is passed {{sources}}.    The problem is that {{sources.schema != sources1.schema}}, and the astrometry subtask is initialized with {{schema1 == sources1.schema}}.  So if the astrometry task needs to fields it added to the schema (the default {{AstrometryTask}} does not), it will likely fail in the second run, as it's being given a catalog that doesn't correspond to the schema it was initialized with.    Comments in the code indicate that there's a desire that future {{AstrometryTask}} s will not take a schema argument, and that would mean that they could be called repeatedly with different schemas (as we are doing).  I'm not sure that's viable; I think it'd probably be appropriate for {{AstrometryTask}} to set flags indicated the sources it's using (or considered using), as the other calibrate subtasks do.    Instead, I think we're probably best off creating two separate astrometry subtasks, each with a different schema, and using the appropriate subtask for each input/output catalog.    Clearly we need to come up with a better solution when in the upcoming {{CalibrateTask}} redesign; two subtasks is obviously clunky.  Whether this is high-priority before then depends on how much we're dependent on {{ANetAstrometryTask}} as a fallback option, and I haven't been following that conversation closely."""

We should move these algorithms to a new plugin system that's run by a new subtask, allowing these plugins to be run entirely separately from {{SingleFrameMeasurementTask}}.

When attempting to run the function 'unitfix' in wcsfix, this buffer can overflow on some fits files (the raw files generated by HSC seem particularly prone to triggering this behavior) and results in the session being terminated on Ubuntu 14.04 as stack protection is turned on by default i.e. the stack crashes with a 'stack smashing detected' error. We have reported the bug to the creators of wcslib. As a temporary workaround, users affected by the bug should increase the default size of 'msg' by increasing WCSERR_MSG_LENGTH defined in wcserr.h      We are providing a small python example that demonstrates the problem. Run it as  python test.py <path to ci_hsc>/raw/<any fits file in this directory>    We are also providing a simple c program to demonstrate the bug.

"DM-5911","Improvement","obs_base",1,"Fix circular references in Mapper objects","""Whilst running tests with pytest and the new file descriptor leak checker it became clear that Mapper objects were not freeing their resources when they were deleted. In particular, the registry objects remained and the associated sqlite database files were opened. This led to pytest running out of file descriptors when large test suites were being executed.    The problem turns out to be the dynamically created map functions. These are created as functions (not bound methods) attached to an instance. Since they are not bound methods the instance object (self) has to be passed in to closure. This leads to self containing a reference to a function that contains a reference to self and this prevents the Mapper from ever being garbage collected (leading to all the resources being retained).    A short term fix is pass the mappers into the closures using {{weakref}}.    Eventually it would be nice to consistently make the {{map_}} items bound methods rather than attaching them as functions but that is beyond the scope of this ticket."""

However, our calib construction code does not support such a path ({{path}} cannot be inferred for new data, and we can't write MEFs from multiple processes).  We believe the best path forward is to split the {{DecamMapper}} into two mappers, one supporting calibs from external sources and one supporting calibs we construct ourselves.  The alternative is to copy the external calibs to match a template like {{BIAS/%(date)s/BIAS-%(date)s-%(ccdnum)02d.fits}}, which means breaking apart the MEFs.

The cause may well be due to slight differences in the reference stars selected for calibration.  We also speculated about differences in slot definitions used in the calibrations steps (e.g. for aperture corrections, psfex, etc...), so I have rerun visit 1322 through both stacks having forced all apertures used in calibration to be the same, namely a circular aperture of 12 pixels measured using the sinc algorithm (as opposed to """"naive"""").  I have attached the *processCcd.py* config files for the two runs so my settings can be reproduced.    Also of note, I am using a {{meas_algorithms}} branch on the HSC stack with the following commit:        I attach some of the figures comparing the PSF fluxes from these runs which compare the output of the two stacks having matched the two src catalogs.  There are two sets: 1) having adjusted the flux for each source to the zeropoint calculated in the calibration and stored as *FLUXMAG0* 2) having adjusted the flux for all sources to a common zeropoint (zp=33.0, chosen to roughly match the calibrated zp).  Note that my figures do include aperture corrections (in DM-5301, many of the plots show fluxes pre-aperture correction).  I have also included plots that directly compare the aperture corrections applied (difference in mag units).  Finally, I also include plots comparing the 12 pixel circular aperture mags (i.e. to which no apCorr is added).    Clearly, the zeropoint determined in the calibration of the two stacks differs between the two stacks and, in particular, there seem to be some very problematic CCDs where the differences are particularly significant (~0.05 mag, and not always in the same direction).

The default coordinate system when """"pure numbers"""" are used should be pixel positions on the original image.     The [spec](http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html) says the following:   """"...the default system is implicitly assumed to be PHYSICAL.

More explanation can be found [here](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/funtools/regcoords.html)    2. PHYSICAL coordinate system does not mean screen pixels. The question is whether we can always use image pixels.    _If wcs is """"physical"""", WCS is the pixel coordinate system of the original image, which may be different from the pixel coordinate system of the current image, if the current image is the result of an imcopy or other geometric transformation operation. In the """"physical"""" coordinate system the ltv, ltm and the axis attribute parameters wtype, axtype, units, label, and format may be edited, but the FITS parameters crval, crpix, and cd cannot_. [reference](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?wcsedit)    3. When used in API, the actions are dispatched one after another. For example, dispatchCreateRegionLayer might be issued before image plot has finished loading. Can we make regionCreateLayerActionCreator wait for image with plotId to finish loading?     More details: If I create a region layer with a few regions in image coordinates right after firefly.showImage, two errors are loaded to console:   doOnAppReady: uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getImageCoords' of null(…),   RegionFactory:602: Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'getImageCoords' of null(…)    4. When a region is selected, yellow dashed line appears around it. On zoom the line does not change color.    5. Can not add empty region. Line 124 of the test script.    6. Can not add or delete regions after the first one. (Load test script, click Show Regions, then Add Region, line 121 of the test script) When there is one region in the layer and you are adding another region with a different position but everything else the same, the added region is perceived to be the same.    7. It's possible to select regions only in in the first region layer added. In the other layer, you can sometimes see the selection blinking, but it does not stay.    8. If region format is wrong, for example  'image; box 40 400 72 72 # color=blue' instead of  'image; box 40 400 72 72 0 # color=blue',   the region is silently ignored, no warning or error is logged to console.    9.

When the first CCD image has been processed, the worker process  continues to process another CCD image, and the execution reaches  here again.  This time, psfCandidate.getWidth() is 41, because  psfexPsfDeterminer has set it to be 41, and the value has been  retained because the width is a static member.  And so, for the second  CCD image, the width of psfCandidate is not 21 but 41.    Since psfCandidates are widened, stars positioned at edges of images  are rejected.  It results in a smaller number of PSF candidates than expected.    Only CCD images that are initially given to the worker processes  are processed with psfCandidate.getWidth() == 21. The other CCD images are  processed with psfCandidate.getWidth() == 41.  When the number of SMP cores changes, CCD images are processed with different  parameters.    The change in the number of PSF candidates results in different Psf, a different  result of image repair, and different catalogs.  {quote}    The line numbers are different on the LSST side because of refactoring (objectSizeStarSelector.py:466 has moved to starSelector.py:148), but the bug is still present.

The behaviour of the matcher has changed in this respect: before the refactoring of astrometry, {{AstrometryTask.useKnownWcs}} would not raise an exception, but log an error and return an empty list of matches (it successfully matched zero sources, which might be cause for concern).    I think we should fix the matcher to return an empty list (as it did previously), but perhaps a case can be made that measureCoaddSources should catch the exception and continue.

These images are from a NIR detector, so they are created from a sequence of raw images in a grid dither pattern, which have been processed and combined to make these final images.

We discussed this by teleconference today.    The [SRD (LPM-17)|http://ls.st/lpm-17*] contains a """"will"""" statement about DM providing """"pre-defined filters optimized for traditionally popular transients, such as supernovae and micro lensed sources"""".    This was flowed down nearly verbatim to the [LSR (LSE-29)|http://ls.st/lse-29*] as LSR-REQ-0026, """"Predefined Transient Filters"""":    {quote}*Requirement:* Pre-defined filters optimized for traditionally popular transients shall be made available. It shall be possible for the project to add new pre-defined filters as the survey progresses.  *Discussion:* The list of pre-defined filters, by way of example, should include ones for supernovae and microlensed sources.{quote}    This requirement was never flowed down to the [OSS (LSE-30)|http://ls.st/lse-30*], the [DMSR (LSE-61)|http://ls.st/lse-61*], or the [DPDD (LSE-163)|http://ls.st/lse-163*], in the space of system-level controlled documents.    The requirement should either be formally disclaimed, which would require a variance against the SRD and a change request against the LSR, or the proper flowdown should be performed.    The latter would be in two parts: a CCB-level change request for the OSS, DMSR, and DPDD, as well as, within DM, the addition of substantive language to [LDM-151|http://ls.st/ldm-151*] towards fulfilling this requirement.    As the OSS and DMSR are currently completely silent on this, it would be acceptable simply to flow down the LSR requirement verbatim to both of these (as if a <copy> relationship in SysML terms).  However, as noted in LIT-101, the DPDD currently contains language which appears to be in conflict with LSR-REQ-0026, specifically:    {quote}we do not plan to provide any classification (eg., “is the light curve consistent with an RR Lyra?”, or “a Type Ia SN?”).{quote}    This would have to be edited to clarify that while we will _not_ attempt to produce _exclusive_ classifications - that is, assignment of objects to unique categories, but we _will_ provide pre-defined filters, with potentially highly overlapping selections, that provide good completeness but perhaps only very modest purity for a small number of object types of common interest.    It is important to retain the notion that this would be done using _only_ LSST data.    Strictly speaking, as a """"pre-defined filter"""" will not be thought of by most of our readers as a """"data product"""", it might not need to be mentioned in the DPDD, but because the existing DPDD language suggests a strong conflict, it would be very good to clarify it.    It will also be important to harmonize what we do about this requirement with what we say about the """"mini-broker"""" in our requirements flowdown, as this is also not currently very clear."""

Problem summary    Qserv *mysql-proxy* service always crashes on queries made on either non-existing databases or made in a lack of any specific database context. The same behavior is obsolved for queries addressed to databases which are present within the MySQL/MariaDB service of the Qserv *master* node while not being registered with Qserv's CSS.    Examples of queries based on the integration test setup:      h1. Details    Once the crash happens no further details found in the service's log files (the report was made by logging into a running Docker container):  {code:bash}  [gapon@lsst-qserv-master01 ~] docker exec -it qserv bash  qserv@lsst-qserv-master01:/qserv$ ls -al run/var/log/  ..  -rw-r--r-- 1 qserv qserv 2193695372 Nov  4 00:52 mysql-proxy-lua.log  -rw-r----- 1 qserv qserv      11811 Nov  4 00:51 mysql-proxy.log  {code}  The only (and the last) relevant record left in *mysql-proxy-lua.log* is about the query causing the crash.

The existing dataset was produced from SDSS stripe82 data, scaled up to 10% DR1 by replicating to cover greater sky area.  Serge thinks we may not be able to similarly reach a 20% DR1 dataset by just scaling coverage (there may not be enough unused coverage).    Instead, we may need to increase chunk density by modifying the replicator to map source HTM cells to HTM cells of the next smaller scale.  This would increase density by a factor of four; we could then either manipulate coverage or thin data during replication to converge on the 20% DR1 target."""

There is an ongoing discussion with DAX team on which information is missing. See    [https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/DM/Data+Access+meeting+2017-09-11]    At the moment, it is not clear how to replace the information in [LSSTMetaInfo.json]([https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly/blob/dev/src/firefly/java/edu/caltech/ipac/firefly/resources/LSSTMetaInfo.json]) (used by SUIT to support PDAC) with the information from metaserv.

This is due to an incomplete workaround for a known issue: [incomplete data IDs with skymap keys cannot be filled in by the registry|https://community.lsst.org/t/problem-with-megacam-dataid/1199/8], because the skymap keys are included in the registry queries but don't exist in the registry tables.  Our usual workaround for datasets like {{forced_src}} (which typically require a registry lookup to fill in unspecified data ID keys) is to do registry lookup on a similar type without a skymap key (such as {{src}}) by calling {{Butler.subset}}.    In {{obs_decam}}, however, the {{src}} template requires only {{visit, ccdnum}}, while {{forced_src}} also requires {{filter}}.  Because the data ID we're passing to {{Butler.subset}} is complete for {{src}}, it skips the registry lookup and passes an incomplete (for {{forced_src}}) data ID on to later code, which fails trying to complete a {{forced_src}} data ID that includes {{tract}}.    There are a few ways I can imagine fixing this:     - We could modify the {{obs_decam}} template to remove {{filter}}.  This is really just a band-aid, but it'd be easy, and since we're discovering this bug now I think it's unlikely there's any DECam CCD forced photometry results sitting on disk that this would break.     - We could copy some of the logic in {{ButlerSubset}} into the data ID mangling code for {{forcedPhotCcd.py}}, having it call {{getKeys}} and {{queryMetadata}} directly to fill out the data ID.  We could alternatively add a new {{Butler}} method to do this more flexibly that the {{forcedPhotCcd.py}} code could delegate to.     - We could modify {{ButlerSubset}} or {{queryMetdata}} to explicitly ignore skymap ({{tract}} and {{patch}}) data ID keys when querying the registry.  I think this would be a simple fix and it would avoid painful workarounds of the sort mentioned above when reading {{forced_src}} data.    [~ktl], [~npease], the last of the above solutions is my preferred one, but I wanted to check with you to make sure you weren't bothered by the special-casing of """"tract"""" and """"patch"""" data ID keys in the butler.

It was done because the default log configuration at that time was disliked.

"DM-8648","Bug","Firefly|SUIT",8,"Image viewer incorrectly displays flux unit when loading multiextension FITS file","""Preparing next release of Herschel image set, Justin is using the IRSAViewer in {{OPS}} to load FITS file _(see attached an example of it that show the problem)_ and has found a problem with the image viewer (readout flux unit is incorrect but other value might be also affected).     When the multiextension FITS file attached is loaded, the 3 images are correctly loaded but the unit shown is the one from the last image ({{coverage}}). From the code, debug shows that  uses NO_BAND as a key, so the {{WebFitsData}} corresponding to each image is overwritten with the last one read.    The consequence is FITS values such as CVAL, NAXIS, and others of the ImagePlot might not be correct. In particular, the flux unit is '1' for all images when it should display 'Jy/beam' in the readout.    [LZ 1-3-2017]   The bug is located at the makeAllNoBand in ImagePlotCreator.java.  When the FITS file has multi-extension and the image is not three color image, each image 's band is NO-BAND.  The WebFitsData containing flux unit, dataMin, dataMax etc, is read in from the FitsRead and is stored in wfDataMap that is a  Map<Band, WebFitsData>.   However, the wfDataMap was created outside the for loop.  When each WebFitsData  is calculated, since the map key=NO_BAND is the same for all the extensions, the value in wfDataMap is replaced by the new value calculated in the loop.   When the loop is over, the wfDataMap contains the last   calculated wfData, ie., the last extension. Thus, the piArray contains three identical elements.   Except the flux unit is wrong, the dataMin, dataMax etc. are wrong as well.        This block shows the correct wfData calculation for the same input (1250p4106_1342188754_SpirePhoto_L20_PMP500_SPG14.0.fits).        This block shows what the value actually received.

Based on a pixels position from the peak, it lies in one of 8 octants that determines which pixel it will use as a reference, but it appears that the transition between reference pixel positions is causing the monotonicity operator to generate weird streaks in the deblended objects that are unphysical.

"DM-9581","Bug","Firefly",2,"MSX image rotation not computed correctly.","""Update From Trey - 2/28:    This problem has nothing to do with WCS match.  It is a problem with rotation of MSX images. They are galactic based which confuses our computation.  To reproduce: Read in MSX image with target m16 and the rotate 180.  The problem is obvious. In this case the relative rotation is computed wrong. The problem begins at FitsRead.createFitsReadRotated.     ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  ORIGINAL TITLE:  WCS match behavior is odd    ORIGINAL DECRIPTION:  Luisa reported 10 days ago on TT (#9353) on the OPS version of Firefly/IRSAViewer:    WCS align works in some odd ways in IRSA Viewer when MSX images are included; it doesn't actually align the MSX image to other images properly. If you align to MSX images, though, it works fine.  I wonder if whatever is going on is somehow tied to the galactic coordinates that the MSX tile should have, though of course the tool should only be paying attention to RA/Dec.    Step to reproduce:  OS 10.11.6  Firefox 51.0.1    search on M16, WISE ch1 (default), default size.  again, new image, MSX A band (default), all other defaults  again, new image, DSS poss2uk red (default), all other defaults.    It returns three images of the sky.  physically what is going on here is that the wise image and the DSS image that are returned should already have north up. the MSX image, however, is in galactic coordinates by default but carries the RA/Dec with it, of course. I just mean the tile is aligned with galactic coordinates by default.    At this point, the DSS image should be “selected” (e.g., outlined in orange).  click WCS match.  WISE doesn’t change, but MSX rotates about 45 degrees. (see first attachment.) here the features in the WISE and POSS images are aligned, so they physically make sense. The MSX one isn’t right.  Click on the MSX image so that it is outlined in orange.  click on WCS match to turn it off. All three images move slightly for me but don’t change orientation.  click on WCS match to turn it on. Now all three images are rotated.  (see second attachment.)  the MSX image didn’t change, but the nebulosity is now aligned properly, so this is really the correct alignment (though note that North isn't up anymore). The tool knows North isn't up; coordinates overlaid and a compass rose overlaid are aligned properly.     (From TT9353)    [March-1-2017 LZ]  I reproduced the bug according to Trey's instruction.  I checked the codes where the rotation is calculated and found that the rotation coordinate somehow is predefined as CoordinateSys.EQ_J2000.  Thus, if the image is not in CoordinateSys.EQ_J2000, the calculation is wrong.  My suggestion is to use the incoming coordinate instead.      """

"DM-10151","Story","meas_deblender",3,"Investigate a better symmetry operator","""The current symmetry operator work by comparing each pixel to its symmetric partner and projecting the difference to zero using a proximal operator, forcing the solution to be symmetric. This works relatively well, but not as well as the current deblender in certain cases. For example, in a blend with only two sources, with one source much brighter than the other, the faint source using the NMF deblender attempts to steal a small amount of flux from its brighter neighbor. We had hoped that the near zero flux opposite the bright source would be enough to limit this effect (when combined with symmetry) but the algorithm breaks when the fainter object wants to steal flux near the same level as the noise. Sparsity is not much help, as l0 sparsity limits the size of brighter objects more than the smaller ones.    This blending issue is accounted for in the current deblender (adapted from SDSS) because it doesn't just force a symmetric solution, it forces the symmetric solution to use the minimum of each pixel and its symmetric partner. This is a much stronger constraint (and more useful) constraint.    It would be useful to update the NMF deblender to have the same minimum pixel value constraint. One way to do this is to use a proximal operator that projects each template onto a space that uses the minimum of each symmetric pair. This will no longer be a linear operation, as choosing the minimum pixel value is non-linear, so it is unclear how this will affect convergence.    If we can make this work, combining the new symmetry operator with monotonicity might eliminate the need to use a sparsity constraint, which is advantageous as [~pmelchior] and I are realizing that sparsity is a wilder beast than it first appeared to be, and taming it is not a simple task. This is because the sparsity of an image is dependent on the total flux in the image, and the brightness of each source, so it might be that using sparsity would require each source in a blend to have a different sparsity requirement dependent on it's brightness, which could be a difficult scheme to implement. Taking care of this directly using a better symmetry constraint is preferable."""

There is no reason to proceed with DM-10310 until we are sure that better positions and the translation operator will improve the deblender performance.    Since this ticket requires re-writing the functions that calculate the likelihood, this will also include updating the intensity matrix ({S}} in the NMF code) so that each source is in the center pixel.

However, we have no identified need for {{Transform}} to transform to {{SpherePoint}} (nor {{IcrsCoord}} except as a base class for {{SkyWcs}}). Furthermore if we have N {{Endpoint}} classes then we instantiate N^2 {{Transform}} classes. So I propose to simply rename for now."""

For simulated data processed by DESC,   [~tjohnson] reported 70GB processes coadding 6kX6k patches and unknown N. (Fill this in if you remember)   For DES data, [~pgee] reported memory usage >32GB  with 10kX10k patches and unknown N.  (Note: patches this large are not recommended). Masks were still uint16 at the time.     Profiling reveals that this memory usage was likely due to holding N masks in memory. In this example, patches were 4200X4200, mask pixels = int32, and N=33. 4200*4200*4*33/2**20 = 2220MiB. Full profiling print out attached.         For the simulated data example, N=~1000, patch size = 6KX6K, mask pixel size = uint16 (May 2016) , would have yielded a theoretical usage of 6e3*6e3*2*1000/2**30 = 67GiB.   For the DES, example with the 10kX10k patches any more than 150 visits would have not fit on the 32G system.    Now that we've switched to int32 masks this is even more important, as the memory usage doubles for examples with  large N or large patches. Even with 4k X 4k patches, it only takes N=180 to get memory usage > 10GB.    This ticket will  remove the assumption that N masks can fit in memory from the implementation of {{CompareWarpAssembleCoadd}}.

When two bands have substantially different mean variance, certain colors converge more quickly than other colors, and at all times are capable of taking larger steps toward the minimum, which we believe results in poor colors in the bands with higher variance. Similarly, images with widely varying pixel variances could also see some pixels reaching convergence more quickly than others (although we have not observed this directly).    To combat this [~pmelchior] and I propose to normalize the weights for SED updates along each band, so that only pixel by pixel variations are weighted for each SED update, and normalize the weights for morphologies along each single band image.

However, SpherePoint rejects such offsets (as well as negative offsets).    I believe the behavior of {{offset}} for a coord at the pole is unambiguous and unsurprising if the coord is constructed from longitude, latitude. However, I acknowledge that this is less so for a coord constructed from a 3-vector. Nonetheless, I propose to change the behavior of SpherePoint to match Coord and document the behavior at the pole.    I also propose to allow negative offsets, as the intent is unambiguous for those and Coord supports it.

For example:  - In some files LTV[12] is specified as 0 in the first HDU and -XY0 as a float in the image HDU. This causes a failure with a complaint about mismatched types. Even if the type is int in the second HDU we end up with an array of values which is not what we want.  - In some files NAXIS[12] is specified as 0 in the first HDU and typical values in the next HDU. This results in an array value for NAXIS[12], which is not what we want.    My suggestion is to write a free function that combines metadata in a FITS-friendly manner:  - For a select few FITS-specific keywords, including COMMENT and HISTORY, use the current behavior: every time the keyword is found, add its value to an array.

"DM-13301","Improvement","Qserv",3,"Configurable worker identity and chunk availability map in Qserv","""This ticket proposes two improvements to be made in a scope of the Qserv worker services:  # replacing the current mechanism of deriving a list of available chunk numbers by parsing table names within the MySQL's _information schema_ with a new one based on an explicit persistent configuration stored within a database. The present mechanism has one major limitation preventing from integrating Qserv with the dynamic chunk replication system - it runs only one time when the worker services are being started. In the proposed model a list of chunk numbers (along with the corresponding table and database names) will be stored in a dedicated table seen by the relevant worker services. This will also allow a consistent view onto a stable collection of chunks. It will also lay a foundation for implementing a safe and efficient coordination mechanism between the replication system and Qserv worker services.  # adding a persistent support for the unique identity of the worker services. The idea here is to store some unique (in a scope of a particular Qserv cluster) name within databases used by the workers. These identifiers will be used as a foundation for setting up worker-specific resources and by the replication system. Extend the implementation and the API of the Qserv's module *wpublish* to support the proposed improvement.    For both tasks make proper changes to the Qserv management, integration and data loading scripts to populate the newly added table with a valid set of chunks and the worker identity strings, so that these resources would be available to the corresponding worker services.

"DM-14291","Improvement","astshim",0.5,"PolyMap.polyTran does not clear IterInverse","""{{PolyMap.polyTran}} replaces the forward or reverse coefficients with a fit. But if it is used to fit the inverse (as is typical) and the original {{PolyMap}} has an iterative inverse, the returned mapping will use that iterative inverse and ignore the fit coefficients.    I have asked David Berry if {{astPolyTran}} is behaving as it should by copying the value of {{IterInverse}} instead of clearing it. I am guessing it is intentional, in which case I can see three solutions:  - Have astshim clear {{IterInverse}} in the returned mapping when appropriate.  - Document the problem and allow {{PolyMap}} to be modified by setting {{IterInverse}} and, presumably, the two related properties, thus breaking the rule that mappings are immutable (other than Id and Ident). Allowing these properties to be set might be useful for tweaking behavior.  - Document the problem and be done with it. I feel this is too surprising to consider.    Of these I feel the first, clearing {{IterInverse}} when appropriate, is most appropriate and least surprising. However, it will require a bit of care, as the original mapping may be inverted and polyTran can fit either direction. I believe the logic is as follows:    If the mapping being fit has IterInverse set:      If the mapping being fit is not inverted and polyTran is fitting the inverse:          unset IterInverse in the returned mapping      if the mapping being fit is inverted and polyTran is fitting the forward direction:          unset IterInverse in the returned mapping    Which simplifies to:  If polyMap IterInverse is set and polyTran forward == PolyMap.isInverted():      unset IterInverse in the returned mapping    Independently it is worth considering allowing modifying the iterative inverse parameters but I'd like a clearer need before doing so.

Footprints are created from region files in the Firefly repo (https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly/tree/dev/src/firefly_data/footprint) and appear to be treated by Firefly as standard DS9 region files where the ra,dec coordinate system is treated as having a relocatable origin and orientation (i.e., as field angles rather than true ra and dec).    It would be very nice to make this capability available (1) in the UI, for region data uploaded from a file by a user, and (2) in the API, for region data sent from the JavaScript and/or Python APIs.    For (1), one possibility would be that the region file upload dialog might get a check-box added to it saying """"make origin movable"""" or """"treat as footprint"""".  Alternatively, an """"upload footprint"""" element might get added to the existing footprint menu.

Since regions can be created by API, not just by file upload, the file name convention can't apply in all cases, so the """"serial number"""" approach may still be appropriate for API uploads.

Using the lsst-lspdev notebook environment and Firefly server, I checked the performance of Firefly panning at zoom level=1 on a 4k by 4k image. Panning to a new position typically took 5-10 seconds but occasionally as long as 20. There is a strong caching effect when panning to a position previously visited, as then the pan typically took between 0.2 and 1 second.    With assistance from Simon, I was able to install the qa_explorer notebook and operate its interactive feature of selecting a star or galaxy from a scatter plot, and zooming and panning to its location on the closest coadd image. The ginga backend typically took a few to 5 seconds to display the desired location. The Firefly backend typically took 15-20 seconds for the display, zoom and pan.    The Firefly display backend always shows the entire image fit to a frame, before zooming and panning to the desired location. Performance could be improved by batching together the initial display, zoom and pan. Alternatively, if DAX imageserv were available it would be more efficient to make a cutout at the desired location and then display it — a solution we used in our forced photometry demo on the PDAC.    The show_fits method of FireflyClient will take an initial zoom level as an argument. For the qa_explorer application, it would be better to set the initial zoom level to 1, to skip the time-consuming display of the entire image. Currently the afw.display abstraction doesn’t support this — it was developed for ds9 where zooming is easy. The mtv method of afw.display could be modified to take optional arguments like zoom level and a position on which to center the display.     """

"DM-14806","Story","lsst_dm_stack_demo",5,"convert stack demo to be a regular eups product","""The """"demo"""" currently exists as a special snowflake feature of jenkins jobs and is not packaged as an an eups product. A script is currently invoked by the CI machinery after an {{lsstsw/lsst_build}} or {{eups distrib install}} has completed which downloads the demo repo from github as a tarball.    An unfortunate consequence of this implementation is that changes on the master branch of the demo result in previous git tags no longer working with the demo when built by {{ci-scripts/lsstsw}} and requires knowledge of the correct git ref to use after a direct {{eups distrib install}}. This also presents an irritation when tagging an official release as there is no source of truth as to where the tag should be located, requiring human intervention. For at least the third time, the demo on master has changed during the release process and now fails with the current release candidate.    A much less error prone solution would be to convert the demo into a regular eups product, which is a dependency of either {{lsst_distrib}} and/or {{lsst_ci}}. This would result in demo metadata being incorporated into eups distrib tags and solving the science-pipeline/demo version mismatch problem both for end users with a local installation and under CI.    I believe the basic tasks to accomplish this would be:   - convert {{lsst/lsst_dm_stack_demo}} into an eups product – essentially add a {{ups}} dir and a table while which depends on {{lsst_apps}}   - add {{lsst_dm_stack_demo}} as a dependency of {{lsst_ci}} and/or {{lsst_distrib}}   - add a test script under {{lsst_ci/tests/}} to trigger a demo run   - remove {{lsst-sqre/ci-scripts/runManifestDemo.sh}} and update {{lsst-sqre/ci-scripts/lsstswBuild.sh}} to not run the demo   - update various jenkins jobs in {{lsst-sqre/jenkins-dm-jobs}} to {{setup lsst_dm_stack_demo}} rather then invoking {{runManifestDemosh.sh}}"""

Single join queries run quickly, but when run with a group of queries the entire system slows down significantly. This is thought to be caused by MariaDB not having sufficient resources and is still being sorted out. MariaDB optimizations should improve the situation. The number of computers in the cluster at in2p3 may simple not have enough resources to meet the KPM30 requirements.    Code was modified to add instrumentation for diagnosis and other changes were made to improve performance.

We recommend the following for implementation:    • If the user explicitly requests a 2D histogram (“heat map”), via API or UI action, they get that no matter what.  It never changes to a scatterplot.  • If the user requests a scatterplot, but there are more than {{N_hist}} (an application-configurable parameter) rows in the associated table, the plot is generated and displayed as a 2D histogram, but it is internally marked as “really” being a scatterplot.  • Then if, as a result of filtering or some other action that changes the size of the table, the number of points falls back to or below {{N_hist}}, the plot is regenerated and displayed as a scatterplot.  • This applies regardless of whether the filter is applied to some other variable(s) in the table or to the plotted variables themselves.  Thus, for example, if the user draws a selection rectangle on the 2D histogram - effectively “zooming in” on a region - which selects {{N_hist}} or fewer points, and clicks on the “filter” button on the plot, the selected region will be re-drawn as a scatterplot.  • There may be a second application-configurable size-limit parameter, less than or equal to {{N_hist}}, which I’ll call {{N_GL}}, which controls a transition between “traditional” Plotly scatterplots and Plotly WebGL scatterplots, with the latter used when the number of points exceeds {{N_GL}}.  The parameterization must allow an application to set {{N_GL = N_hist}} or use some equivalent means of requiring that the WebGL scatterplot never be used.  (Eventually, however, we hope that the WebGL scatterplots become a complete replacement for the traditional ones.)    This issue has already been through """"FireflyCCB-D""""-style review and we are requesting implementation.    The schedule should be discussed at today's CCB meeting.

On the database side, I think we'd need to add a field to the visit table indicating which of several named systems the visit belongs to, while ensuring that visit IDs are unique across all systems.  We'd select exactly one system via configuration to be used by any butler client, though we'd need to think about when we'd have to be able to refer to other systems instead of relying on that selection (e.g. when interacting with datasets produced on some other system).  We'll also need to move the {{exposure.visit}} field into a separate join table.    The way information about visits will be transmitted from the LSST hardware is via a """"GROUP"""" header card; to make use of that, we should:   * propagate that through ObservationInfo into the exposure table during raw ingest;   * remove visit definition (and all of the stuff dealing with visit regions) from raw ingest;   * add a new task to be run after ingest that creates visits (with regions, where appropriate) from groups of exposures with the same GROUP value.  That would involve generating visit IDs and names from GROUP via some algorithm.

One solution is to extend the max time that the ATS CSC will wait for a response - which will allow even more delay to accumulate - then if the max time is exceeded, the system is put in Fault state as there is no response ACK.    Another solution is to NOT make the CSC dependent on the ACK arriving within a prescribed window of time, and simply address the result set information in the ACK when it arrives.[1] There is already an Forwarder health check every exposure, as well as a check that the transfer params were received by working Forwarders - both of which will send the system to FAULT state in no Forwarders are available to work...if a Forwarder dies during EndReadout, the AT CSC will know that an ACK was +never+ received. Then the health state of the Forwarder will be checked on the next exposure.

This results in million rows of mostly unneeded data stored in the databases each time such synchronization is happening.

Another problem with the implementation is the rapid growth of the database space used by the Replication system (roughly 200 GB over 48 hours).    In this ticket the detailed reporting of the database names and chunks numbers will be replaced with a simple counter of replicas sent to Qserv workers by each such request.
