"EVG-1487","Bug","app",1,"build_id and task_id have a race condition for patch builds","""Recent discussions and inspection gave me the impression that expansions work roughly this way (where """"roughly"""" means I'm not trying to be specific about how reserved characters are converted to dashes or underscores or whatever):    * project' – key for project in evergreen  * 'revision' – SHA1 of a commit in the repo for the project  * 'build_variant' – entry in the 'buildvariants' part of the config.yml  * 'task_name' – task name from 'tasks' part of config.yml  * 'version_id'  ** For commits: roughly {{""""$\{project\}\_$\{revision\}""""}}  ** For patches: a unique ID  * 'build_id' – roughly {{""""$\{project\}\_$\{build_variant\}\_$\{revision\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}""""}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{""""$\{project\}\_$\{build_variant\}\_$\{task_name\}\_$\{revision\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}""""}}  * 'execution' – number of times a 'task_id' has executed (starting at 0)    My understanding is that TIMESTAMP is the commit timestamp for commits and the submission time for patches.    From this, it appears that it is possible for two patches on the same commit submitted at the same TIMESTAMP to wind up with the same 'build_id's and 'task_id's.    Without considering backwards compatibility issues, it looks like for patch builds, the 'build_id' and 'task_id' should be using the 'version_id' in place of the 'revision' field.    Alternatively, if 'version_id' for patches were 'project_<UNIQUEID>', then 'build_id' and 'task_id' could remove the 'project' and 'revision' expansions and just use 'version_id' instead, as it would include project information and a unique identifier:    * 'build_id' – roughly {{""""$\{version_id\}\_$\{build_variant\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}""""}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{""""$\{version_id\}\_$\{build_variant\}\_$\{task_name\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}""""}}    It would be even more consistent, perhaps, to put timestamp after 'version_id' since that's what it's tied to, which would give you:    * 'build_id' – roughly {{""""$\{version_id\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}\_$\{build_variant\}""""}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{""""$\{build_id\}\_$\{task_name\}""""}}    TIMESTAMP could even go first, before 'version_id', which has the added value of allowing id's to sort chronologically (e.g. listing contents of an S3 bucket):    * 'build_id' – roughly {{""""$\{TIMESTAMP\}\_$\{version_id\}\_$\{build_variant\}""""}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{""""$\{build_id\}\_$\{task_name\}""""}}    Following that logic, you could add a new expansion:    * 'expansion_id' – roughly {{""""$\{task_id\}\_$\{expansion\}""""}}    Then all the unique identifier expansions would build logically and consistently on each other.    That would simplify the job of users choosing an expansion for naming artifacts to S3:    * Need something to reuse across tasks for a build: use just 'build_id'  * Need some task output for external consumption (e.g. a release tarball): use just 'task_id'  * Need to save debugging output from a particular task run: use just 'execution_id'"""

Given a time.Time field, several API models are using naive type casting to coerce these fields into APITime fields, which truncates location data and results in off-by-4-hours errors. Instead we should be using the model.NewTime method which first converts the input time to a location of UTC before populating APITime fields.     Furthermore, the serialization of the time in the actual pagination function is also incorrect. Rather than format the next page's first time properly using time.Format, we currently use the .String() method which again improperly truncates the location data but also uses the wrong format.    Routes affected include but are not limited to build, metrics, and hosts."""

This approach produces abnormal values distribution. For example, ratio 1/3 is closer to 1 than ratio 3/1.  To fix this issue we could use different approaches:  * apply log function: log(Sa / Sb). In this case log(1/3) = -log(3/1) and also log(1/1) = 0 (I think it fits the best for charts, for example trend chart)  * or modify existing function, so we could keep percentages: (sign(Sa / Sb) * max(Sa. Sb) / min(Sa, Sb) -1. For example for 3 / 1 it will give 2 (or 200%), for 1 /3 it will give -2 (or -200%), for 1 / 1 it will give 0(%).    Both approaches will produce normal distribution with peak near 0."""

I believe we should do two things:   # Query Splunk for the logging in describeHourlySpotPriceHistory and getLatestLowestSpotCostForInstance to determine if one of these functions represents the bulk of the calls to DescribeSpotPriceHistory.

(The two cases use different parameters, but I think this is only because getLatestLowestSpotCostForInstance passes a future date to only get the latest price, so we can make the calls identical).

Moving a box from -test to -build confirmed my theory of distro config differences.    The only difference I was able to find was the checkbox 'Disable scheduling this distro. Tasks already in the schedule will be dispatched.' that was set for -test. Unchecking it seems to have resolved the problem.    Failing to deploy the agent 10 times results in quarantining the host. If the connection between disabling scheduling tasks and quarantining the hosts in the distro can make some sense in theory, it doesn't seem right that it's intentional because it requires 10 failed agent deploys. Also, unchecking that box doesn't automatically unquarantine the servers in that distro, so this logic seems incorrect.    Is this behavior intentional?"""

"EVG-6142","Improvement","app",2,"Evergreen CLI patch command should not submit uncommitted changes by default","""*Motivation*: The Evergreen CLI merge queue command submits only committed changes to Evergreen's merge queue, since we want to reduce the risk of a developer submitting changes to the merge queue that they don't actually wish to commit.    Evergreen GitHub pull request testing has a similar interface. To be included in a pull request, the code must be committed locally.    Evergreen's patch command differs. It includes changes to files tracked by git that have changed in the working directory but have not yet been committed. This has been confusing for users in the past (e.g., EVG-782). It also does not match the merge queue command, which will mean that users of the merge queue via the CLI might submit code reviews that differ from what they ship to the merge queue.    *Solution*: Evergreen's patch command currently supports submitting only committed changes by passing the {{--ref}} flag. This ticket will make that the default.    Many teams outside the server use pull request testing and will therefore be unaffected. However, some teams may rely on the current behavior and may be surprised by the change. To address this, we will   * Warn the user when they are submitting a patch if there uncommitted changes in their working directory.   * Send an email notifying users that we are making this change.   * Add an option to the {{patch}} command that preserves the old behavior.   * Add an option to the .evergreen.yml that will cause the old behavior to be the default    The feature is documented in the Evergreen Wiki: [https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/Using-the-Command-Line-Tool#working-tree-changes]"""

This will be fixed in the new scheduler, but we turned that on for a single distro today. Since we may discover bugs in the new scheduler and need to revert back to the legacy scheduler, we should put in some improvements to reduce database load when hosts are idle for the legacy scheduler. These should include  1. Persist the entire queue. If the queue is long, and the head of the queue contains only undispatchable task group tasks, there may be dispatchable tasks at the tail.  2. Agents should back off getting the next task. Currently they only jitter, with a 10-second interval.  3. Revert the change to increase idle host time for hosts that just ran a task group.
