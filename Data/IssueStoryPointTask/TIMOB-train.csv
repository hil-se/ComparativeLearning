"TIMOB-3200","New Feature","Android",13,"Android: Add radio button group support","*Summary:*  We should add a radio button group like feature on all platforms (Android, iOS, and Windows) where a horizontal layout of buttons are displayed, but only one option can be selected at a time.    On Android and Windows, this is a built-in UI component that we should use.  https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/radiobutton    On iOS, this should be implemented via a {{UISegmentedControl}}.  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/segmented-controls    *Recommend Solution:*  Should be implemented in Titanium similar to {{Ti.UI.TabbedBar}}...  https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.TabbedBar    The idea is that the Titanium developer creates the ""group"" view, but does not have access to the individual buttons within the group. This will help make it more portable between Android and iOS.    The radio buttons will be created via a creation-only ""labels"" property, which is assigned an array of strings, just like how it works with {{Ti.UI.TabbedBar}} and {{Ti.UI.ButtonBar}}.    We should also support an ""index"" property to indicate which button is selected and the ""click"" event when a button has been clicked on. This is how it's implemented in {{Ti.UI.TabbedBar}} as well.    The layout should be horizontal by default. Especially since iOS' {{UISegmentedControl}} can only be displayed horizontally. Vertical layout support would be nice, but it is only natively supported on Android and Windows.    *Future:*  We may also want to support the ""Choice Chips"" feature as shown in Google's material design below. New {{Chip}} and {{ChipGroup}} Java classes have been added to Google's Support Library version 28. This could be implemented via the view's ""style"" property in the future.  https://material.io/design/components/chips.html  "

This is preventing Titanium from creating the Android AVDs needed to test apps, giving the following error:    [TRACE] Error: 'C:\Users\tom' is not recognized as a valid sdcard value. It looks like the command that creates the avd is stripping away part of the string when it tries  to create an avd. I've manage to track down a function 'create_avd' in 1.4.0/android/builder.py which I think may be the culprit, but I'm not sure where to go from there. The sdcard has been created, so the problem must be after that point.    There are a multitude of methods for renaming the user folder, none of which are straight forward (registry edits, etc.). I'm hoping someone can tell me a way of making Titanium function with this, albeit rare and idiotic, usage case.    Does anyone have any suggestions?"

"TIMOB-4341","Bug","Android",1,"2nd instance of application run from a separate process causes NullPointerException","The latest version of the Urban Airship SDK supports a new notification handling process, whereby the PushService can be configured to run in a separate process. When it is configured in that manner it creates a 2nd instance of the application which in turn results in the OnCreate method of TiApplication being called a 2nd time. The result is a NullPointerException occurring somewhere in that method.    The workaround for now is to configure the PushService to run within the current application process, but UA recommends running it in a separate process to conserve memory.    The following excerpt is from the Urban Airship documentation on how to resolve this issue:      Process Management    It is possible to run the push service either in your application process or as a separate stand-alone process. We recommend that most applications run it in a separate process. The primary benefit to this approach is that it allows the service to run with a relatively small memory footprint even if your application is resource intensive. In a low memory situation the OS can kill a backgrounded application's main process without disrupting the service.    To run the service in a separate process, simply add the ""android:process"" attribute to the service element and provide a name for the process. If the name starts with a colon, the process will be private to your application:    <service android:name=""com.urbanairship.push.PushService"" android:process="":aPrivateProcess""/>  Note that when the service runs in a separate process it will create a separate instance of the application when the service is started. This means that your application's onCreate() method will be called again in another context. For most applications this is not an issue, but if the onCreate method invokes any code that should only be called once (such as analytics code that changes state outside of the application) you will want to ensure that it only runs in one of the processes. The following sample illustrates a method for determining which process your application is running within:    public class MyApplication extends Application {      public void onCreate() {          // the main process for this application is named for the package          // if this is the default process, run some special code          if (isProcess(context.getPackageName()) {              //run default process operations here          }      }        private boolean isProcess(String processName) {          Context context = getApplicationContext();          ActivityManager actMgr = (ActivityManager)context.getSystemService(Context.ACTIVITY_SERVICE);          List<RunningAppProcessInfo> appList = actMgr.getRunningAppProcesses();          for (RunningAppProcessInfo info : appList) {              if (info.pid == android.os.Process.myPid() && processName.equals(info.processName)) {                  return true;              }          }          return false;      }    }  "

"TIMOB-5882","New Feature","iOS",0,"iOS: Add Android Style Picker On iPhone","Titanium currently allows the option to force Android to use an iOS-style ""spinner"" picker. Would it be possible to also allow an option to force iOS to use an Android-style ""flat"" picker?    An example use-case for this is when wanting a picker mechanism as part of the layout of a screen (kind of like how an HTML form has a dropdown list), or in any case where the iOS picker's size (216px/pt tall) is too large for the desired UX.     Setting this override could use the existing useSpinner option (and default to true on iOS), or replace the useSpinner property with probably a more flexible ""spinnerStyle"" property with options like ""system default"", ""android"", and ""iphone"". The default would be, obviously ""system default"", while the other two options would provide overrides for their opposite platform (ie - setting style:""iphone"" on an iPhone would simply use the default, but setting style:""android"" on an iPhone would trigger the override)."

"TIMOB-7249","Bug","Android",0.5,"Android: Intent - getData(), getAction(), and getType() do not work","h2. Problem    When deciding how an app should handle an incoming Android Intent, knowing the type, action, and data values that were sent with the Intent are critical. If your app only handles one very specific Intent, this is OK, but if you have an app that handles images, URIs, video,, etc... you need to know these values.     Right now when an Intent is received via Intent Filter in Titanium, the following lists the values/errors you will get for the data, type, and action functions and properties of an Intent:    * {{getData()}} always equals {{null}}   * {{getType()}} and {{getAction()}} always throw this exception, despite the fact that logic and documentation dictates that these functions do not require arguments:  {code}Uncaught Error: Requires property name as first argument{code}  * The {{data}} property always returns {{null}}  * The {{action}} and {{type}} properties always return {{undefined}}    h2. Proposed Solution    The above listed functions and properties need to return the appropriate values for {{data}}, {{type}}, and {{action}} so that developers will know what to do with the Android Intent that they are receiving. Like I said, if you are handling only one type of data as dictated by your Intent Filter, you are OK. But if you plan to handle images, video, etc... and you need to read them from Ti.Android.EXTRA_STREAM, you have no way of knowing which type of Intent you are receiving.    Also, I believe the implementation of {{getAction()}} and {{getType()}} need to change so that they do not require a parameter.    h2. Test Case    {code:javascript}  var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({      backgroundColor: '#fff',      fullscreen: false,      exitOnClose: true  });  win.addEventListener('open', function(e) {      var intent = Ti.Android.currentActivity.getIntent();      var iname = Ti.Android.EXTRA_STREAM;         if (intent && intent.hasExtra(iname)) {       Ti.API.info(intent.getAction());       Ti.API.info(intent.getData());       Ti.API.info(intent.getType());      } else {          Ti.API.info('No extra named ""' + iname + '"" found in Intent');      }  });  win.open();  {code}    It will also be necessary to add an intent filter to a custom AndroidManifest.xml to get this test case to receive intents. The only below needs to go in the main activity and will receive all image share intents. You can easily trigger an image share intent by long clicking on an image in the android gallery then select 'share' from the intent list. Then just select your test case app from the list.    {code:xml}  <intent-filter>      <action android:name=""android.intent.action.SEND"" />      <category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" />      <data android:mimeType=""image/*"" />  </intent-filter>  {code}"

Extra info  This seems to be timing dependent, so you may have to repeat the 2 clicks several times. I can make it happen in under 30 seconds...usually within 5 seconds. My best reproduction comes by waiting 2.5 seconds before clicking the back button. If you have trouble reproducing this, vary the time between seeing the second window and clicking the back button (faster and then slower).    After some investigation, I can see that the 'close' event of the second window never fires when the problem occurs (neither does the focus event of the first window).    This seems to point to a serious flaw. In a larger app, the failure occurs 80% of the time. Our app is totally dead in the water because of this, and we need to release it soon. Can you please take a look into this?    Please note that I've reduced this down about as far as possible, while still demonstrating the error. Removing any of the references to Ti.App or removing any of the event listeners hides the problem, but all of my apps are dependent on these."

We want to make sure we start from a clean slate.  *2.* Make sure you have your USB cable connected to your laptop and phone.  *3.* Run the KitchenSink app, wait for it to load and press the home button (don't press the back button, but instead the home button!)  *4.* Run a few other apps in the background, I ran 'Gmail', 'Contacts', 'Internet', 'Peep', 'Places', 'Stocks' and 'Market'. It's important that you press the home button and NOT the back button! (NOTE if it doesn't work for you the first time, try opening more or even less apps, it might make a difference, depending on the device's specs).  *5.* Once you have some apps running in the background, make sure you are back on the main home screen.  *6.* Press the power button (lock your screen, turn the screen off, but don't power the device off!)  *7.* Unplug the USB cable.  *8.* Unlock your phone.  *9.* Press on the KitchenSink app icon.  *10.* Expect to see a black background for a second or two and then it will restart the app.  *11.* If you don't, repeat from step 1.      *Notes*  -Different apps behave differently. The KitchenSink app, for example, seems to show a black background for 1-2 seconds and then restart the whole app. Other apps, such as Mister (from Google Play), actually shows a black screen and never continues to do anything else.

The ""assets"" and ""framework"" folders should be separate so we don't have conflicts. The only complication would be that the require() and include() functions might need a flag to know whether the app has been bootstrapped or not (ie read from ""framework"" if bootstrapping and ""assets"" if not). A flag may not be sufficient if things are done asynchronously so the other solution would be to check if the file calling the require/include is in ""framework"" or ""assets"" and make sure to load the file from the same directory.    There should be one file called boostrap.js that will include/require the other files, as needed."

Expected Result:    Success (no gperf dependency), or a meaningful error message.    Note that the inclusion of gperf causes overhead for Titanium Studio to include built-in software prerequisites."

"TIMOB-12551","Story","Android|CLI|Code Processor|Core|iOS",0,"JavaScript-to-JavaScript optimizing compiler","The performance of native bridge invocations shall be improved in Q1  for both iOS and Android. This will be done by creating an optimizing  javascript-to-javascript compiler that identifies non-performant  Titanium API use-cases and transforms them into performant native  bridge invocations.    The plan for completing this task is:    1. Automate collection of app performance data.    2. Identify Titanium performance bottlenecks from performance data.    3. Analyze javascript AST for common Titanium API idioms.    4. Create optimization algorithms (AST transformations) for these     idioms identified as performance bottlenecks.      From Jeff's README.md in his compiler prototype project:    Compiler Prototype  ==================    The compiler prototype is a simple set of compile-time optimizations  that are applied to speed up native bridge invocations.    Concept  -------    The concept is very simple.      The Javascript native bridge binds a set of JavaScript objects (the  Titanium API) and eventually a method is bound into a callback  implementation in native land.  The JS engine performs native bridge  calls to lookup the JavaScript object and eventually invoke the bound  native function in this simple example:     > Ti.API.log('foo')    The JS engine makes the following invocations underneath the cover:     > Ti => Object   > Object.API => Object   > Object.log => Function   > Function('foo')    So, a simple one-liner requires 4 invocations in the JS engine.    Additionally, in this example, foo is an argument that must be  marshalled from a JS native object into a native object.  In  Objective-C, this turns a JSValueRef (or JSStringRef) into a  NSString. This happens before the underlying JSFunction is mapped into  an Objective-C method.  To make matters worse, in Objective-C, we have  to do additional lookups to find the appropriate TiModule and then  build an NSInvocation to invoke the method against the Objective-C  class.  All of this takes time.    This prototype attempts to speed up the invocation above by performing  a few simple steps.    First, we avoid the Object lookups by turns a Titanium API into a  bound symbol in the JS engine. So, Ti.API.log become T$1 (as an  example).    Second, we attempt to speed up static arguments that are required to  be marshalled during invocation into a symbol table which are only  marshalled once. The symbol table is pre-compiled and subsequent  references of the same symbol will use a pre-marshalled copy.    Third, we pre-bind a compiled method and set of pre-marshalled  arguments into a jump table. This is similar to using a function  pointer (but as an instance of a compiled pointer to a module and  invocation).    The result is that you can get 50-75% pure invocation speed ups.  For  methods that have static arguments, you can achieve even better  results.    Limitations  -----------    The current prototype uses a titanium module and requires a compile  method to be called at the top of each compiled file to load up the  symbols and bind the symbols. This has convenience in that we can do  it without having to make any changes to Titanium itself.  However, we  may want to consider adding the compile method into Titanium  (unpublished) to make maintenance easier and eliminate the need for a  module.    The second limitation is that we are speeding up only function calls  and a few global symbols (such as Ti.UI.FILL).  Eventually, we may  want to do the same to properties.    Third, the prototype is using a compiler hook (good) but only is  working with Alloy.  This is not a limitation per se, but i didn't  want to have to deal with figuring out how to redirect the compiled JS  files into a separate temporary directory and causing XCode to point  at that instead of Resources -- since we don't want to override  Resources (except in Alloy, that's how it operates, so that's OK).    Fourth, I'm using a uglify-based compiler by hand instead of using  Bryan's titanium code processor.  The current implementation of the  code processor doesn't allow you to mutate code in his plugins (or in  the processor itself).  Ideally, this would actually be a code  processor plugin that would simply mutate code in a pipeline during  compilation.    Fifth, the current prototype is iOS only.  This is because I'm most  familiar with iOS and don't know the Android compiler / bridge for V8  as well as the old version.  However, I think this same concept works  for Android conceptually.    Six, since I'm not using the code processor, I'm not using the JSCA  file to understand the API. Moving to the code processor eliminates  that issue.    The last overall limitation is that we might want to actually  pre-compile out the jump tables and use actually compiled function  callbacks instead of the TiCompiledMethod object.  If we moved to more  of a true compiled / generated code, that would be rather trivial.  This would likely give us even more speedup and much less object  garbage and much lower memory.  You would simply generate the C  function that would directly call the module and method instead of  having to have a generic TiCompiledMethod and you could by pass the  entire Kroll overhead. I believe the new V8 compiled bindings do  something similar in Android.    Components  ----------      ## CLI Hook    The CLI hook file is under plugins/ti.compiler/hooks and in the file  ti.compiler.js      ## Module Source    The module source for iOS is under compiler_module.      Notes  -----    The ti.compiler plugin must come after the ti.alloy in tiapp.xml.      Afterthought  ------------    I think this concept can be dramatically further expanded to really  build a compiler that can pre-process code and optimize, compile and  generally make performance a lot faster than it does today.    ## Collapsing properties    For example, take the following code:     var v = Ti.UI.createView();   v.width = Ti.UI.FILL;   v.height = Ti.UI.FILL;   v.backgroundColor = ""red"";   w.add(v);    This could easily be re-written to be much faster (prior to  optimizations from prototype):     w.add(Ti.UI.createView({width:Ti.UI.FILL,height:Ti.UI.FILL,backgroundColor:""red""}));    After optimizations further:     w.add(T$1());     ## Multiple invocations    Another example that is common, adding multiple objects to a view  heirarchy.     w.add(view1);   w.add(view2);   w.add(view3);    This could be optimized into:     w.add(view1,view2,view3);    In this example, passing 3 objects over a view to add to the window  will be MUCH faster because you go from 3 separate invocations to one  and more importantly, because this method is required to be invocked  on the UI Thread, 3 separate UI thread blocks.    Additionally, at some point, you could move the same optimized method  onto the native side such as it would turn into the following:     T$1();    And on the native side, it would simply do the work of adding the 3  views to a window by native references.    ## Subsequent code blocks    My ultimate belief is that most of the static code written in Titanium  JS can be pre-compiled and essentially reduced into few JS engine  functions.    Take the following static code block:     var w = Ti.UI.createWindow();   var v = Ti.UI.createView({width:TI.UI.FILL,height:TI.UI.FILL,backgroundColor:""white""});   var b = Ti.UI.createButton({    text:""Hello"",    width:TI.UI.SIZE,    height:Ti.UI.SIZE   });   v.add(b);   w.add(v);   b.addEventListener(function(){    alert(""hello world"");   });   w.open();    This should be able to be reduced in JS code to:     var r$1 = T$1(), w = r$1[0], v = r$1[1], b = r$1[2];   b.addEventListener(function(){    alert(""hello world"");   });   w.open();    We should be able to take subsequent code blocks that are static and  collapse them into code blocks in native that can be mapped to one JS  symbol pointer.    ## String consts    We might be able to get much better optimizations in the JS engine by  turning static code strings into JS consts at compile time.  In a ton  of cases in an app, you will use inline strings.  Its generally faster  to declare them as a const and then use the const variable name  instead.  This could be a simple optimizations done by the compiler.    ## Dead code removal    We need to remove dead code or unused variables and functions.  For  example, in Alloy in the alloy.js file, we define a function named  isTabletFallback.  This method isn't used.  We could simply optimize  on compile and deterine which functions / symbols are reachable and  then remove them if not.    For example, Alloy generates the following:     var Alloy = require(""alloy""), _ = Alloy._, Backbone = Alloy.Backbone;     Alloy.createController(""index"");    This is useful is you need to reference Backbone or underscore  libraries in the app.js stub.  However, in almost all scenarios, the  developer never does this in a standard Alloy app.    The code above could be easily reduced to the following if it's not  modified:     require('alloy').createController('index')    This creates no variables in memory that have to be later garbage  collected and is much more efficient in execution.        - Jeff  "

"TIMOB-12661","New Feature","Android|Tooling",3,"CLI: Support adb's -s option for pointing a build to a specific emulator or device","It would be extremely helpful, and give the CLI more power with Android, if developers were able to specify specifically which device or emulator for which they would like to build. Right now the build process allows us to specify and avd id which would let you pick an emulator, but even that is not ideal as you don't really have a way of knowing an emulator's id from the *android list avd* as it isn't listed.    Ideally, I should be able to call *adb devices*, see my listing of emulators and devices, than be able to pass that serial number to the *titanium build* command as an option, directing the build process to that specific emulator or device. The build process _tries_ to be intelligent about this, but more often than not I get errors like:    * It fails if there is a connected device AND an emulator open  * Even with an emulator already it open, it often attempts to load an entirely different one  * Tries to use emulators not compatible with the app (like a non-Google API emulator with an app that uses maps)    Allowing a command like the following would make it really easy for developers to have multiple open emulators and connected devices and still get expected behavior:        Obviously I leave the choice of the option flag to the implementor.

"TIMOB-14449","Story","Tooling",1,"Include platform-specific dependency information underneath Mobile SDK platform subfolder","Titanium/Appcelerator Studio has a file named sdk_info.json that we grab from a server and use to determine extra dependencies for specific platforms. An example is that we have entries that point the range of Tizen SDKs we support, XCode versions, Android addons/api levels, etc. This information is not something Studio should be maintaining, and it does not take into context the current project's Mobile SDK - so we apply the dependencies globally, regardless of whether the user is using 1.7.5 or 3.2.0 - which can mean the dependencies are not correct (older versions of the SDK supported older ranges of XCode and Tizen, e.g.).    This knowledge and maintenance of dependencies should be pushed to the individual platforms, ideally in some relatively standard dependency.json file that is effectively just the segment of the sdk_info.json for that platform.    Here's the current sdk_info.json file. This is a good starting point, but there are deficencies I will point out after:      In particular for Android the regular expressions used are brittle and difficult to reconstruct since they match against the expected installed directory/filenames, while we need to compare against an xml file with the segments broke out into ""fields"". i.e. ""addon-google_apis-google-10"" is the directory on disk, but in xml the ""google_apis"" is the ""name-id"" value, ""google"" is the vendor_id"" value and ""10"" is the api level. Ideally we'd break that out more explicitly: Here's a suggestion for how the android platforms' file would look:      In general my suggestions are to use Node/npm semantic versioning strings rather than our haphazard version, range or regex approach. Additionally, explicitly state the addon unique id as a key (here I'm assuming the unique id is a combination of name_id and vendor_id). Lastly, break out the dependencies required by mobile versus module development.    As for the URLs we have here, I'm not sure if we should be including them here or not."

In order to have an simulator with a performance like the iOS Simulator we need to setup a x86 android emulation with Intel HAXM support. The problem is that by using the native AVD on Android SDK you can do this setup BUT without the Google APIs, namely the GMaps API, which makes testing apps depending on those APIs, impossible on this high performance simulation.    Although it is possible to add Google APIs to a standard x86 AVD, the process is very complex and involves copying the libraries from other non-x86 AVDs and rebuilding a system image which takes a lot of time and effort for each simulator setup you want to have.    So Genymotion does it all under the hood and allows us to select between several android models and even simulate external sensors and GPS location, much like the Apple Simulator does.    The standard Titanium build script has some problems that causes the Simulator session not to be recognized as a valid deployment target (using titanium build -p android -T device), even though adb successfully recognizes the simulation under adb devices.    In order to fix this I have found some hints on a russian weblog and changed it a bit for working on my Mac.    I have successfully run my Titanium app on Genymotion using Titanium CLI by doing the following:      http://reinraus.ru/wordpress/nastraivaem-titanium-studio-dlya-zapuska-prilozhenij-v-android-x86/    It is written in Russian, so please use the Google  Translate tool, he has made 3 changes on the build script.

Proposal  # Add a new dictionary parameter to Ti.UI.createWindow and createTabGroup, attachAndroidModule: 'modulename'  # If attachAndroidModule is specified, the module is loaded prior to Activity creation and its lifecycle events correspond to those of the created UI Activity.  # The Javascript does not change - the module is ""required"" and used as before.  # Clearly the module can be attached to multiple Activities in a Titanium app - just as an Android library can be used by multiple Activities in in a native Android app, and in each case the events correspond to the Activity in use.  # I would deprecate the current lifecycle events in the Android module, since they're confusing in the Android context. However, if desired, I suppose it's possible to maintain ""legacy"" module behavior (per module) through tiapp.xml configuration parameters.    This is yet another stumbling block to easy porting of 3rd party code. The Titanium community would greatly benefit from this improvement."

Problem Description  The 320x180 image in the testcase should be scaled UP to fill the width of the window (left: 0, right: 0) with it's height automatically adjusted to maintain the image aspect ratio.     This is exactly what happens on iOS. On android, the ImageViewHeight is contstrained to the original image height, and the image's aspect ratio is maintained, thus leaving a large unfilled area to the left and right of the image.     Since the size is set to Ti.UI.SIZE, the expected behaviour would be that the image is scaled up to fit the full width of the ImageView and it's size adjusted upward to fit the contents of the scaled up image. Again, on iOS this expected behaviour is exactly what happens. But on Android, you get the unexpected result of an image with limited width.    h4. Steps to reproduce  1.

"TIMOB-16078","New Feature","Android|iOS",8,"Implement full NodeJS require specs so we can use NPM for modules","I know from [~jhaynie] that Hyperloop (and thus Ti.Next - likely Titanium 4.x) will support the full [NodeJS require specs|http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html] so to make it possible to use NPM as a package manager for all kinds of modules. This is also the direction ALOY-86 has been going, asking for widget dependency management.    I open this ticket to request looking into the possibility of implementing this in Titanium 3.x already.    * What are the obstacles to change the require implementation to require both JS and native modules from the local and global {{node_modules}} paths?  * What does it take to get Alloy to loading e.g. widgets from local and global installed {{node_modules}}?  * How should the builder copy in global {{node_modules}} to the project when it packages the app?    I think this would spur and new wave of Titanium native/CommonJS modules and Alloy widgets, sync adapters etc that would really boost the platform, as well as making it easier to re-use proprietary components in multiple projects myself.    Ultimately, I think {{tiapp.xml}} and {{manifest}} could even be replaced by {{package.json}}?"

"TIMOB-16488","Improvement","iOS",13,"iOS: Property List lacks of Secure Class Protection - NSFileProtectionKey","h3. Issue    After a revision from customer Vulnerability assessment team they have raised a low priority issue in reference that the Property List lacks of Secure Class Protection  - NSFileProtectionKey    The list of files they are referring to is basically everything in the installed package on the device (Cache.db, Cookies.binarycookies, etc.)    h3. Description    On iOS, every file is encrypted with an unique encryption key as illustrated in the image. The content of a file is encrypted with a per-file key, which is wrapped with a class key (data protection class key) and stored in a file metadata, which is in turn encrypted with the file system key (EMF key). The file system key is generated from the hardware UID. UID is unique per device and it is embedded in hardware and inaccessible to code running on CPU.    A file which is encrypted only with the file system key, upon physical access to the device custom ramdisk techniques can be used to steal the file from passcode protected devices. To overcome this problem Data protection was introduced. Data protection protects the data at rest on iOS devices using encryption keys that are tied to the device passcode and UID. So if the file is protected with a data protection class and the user sets a passcode for the device, an attacker cannot access the file using custom ram disk technique until he knows the passcode. Data protection provides another layer of security to files by encrypting them with a passcode generated key. File protection is enabled by setting an accessibility constant to NSFileProtectionKey file attribute. Later the files are encrypted with a protection class key respective to the accessibility constant marked for that file.    Ex: If a file is marked with NSProtectionComplete accessibility constant then the file is encrypted with Class 1 protection class key and it is available only when the user unlocks the device. If a file is created without specifying any accessibility constant then the file is marked as NSProtectionNone and it is accessible even the device is locked . List of accessibility constants available for files are shown in the below table.    h3. iOS Reference    https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSFileManager_Class/Reference/Reference.html    "

"TIMOB-16879","New Feature","Android|iOS",5,"ScrollableView: Add ""insertViewsAt()"" method","The ScrollableView currently supports the "".addView()"" method to programmatically append additional views to the end of the collection. However, it has no method to insert one or more views at the beginning (prepend), or somewhere in the middle of the collection.    A [suggested workaround|http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/161891/scrollable-view---insert-a-view-into-a-specific-spot] for this limitation involves getting the views array with .getViews(), updating the array, then re-assiging the views array back to the control with .setViews(). While this works, it is not efficient and causes significant flickering on the UI with complex views, every time .setViews() is used.    It would be great to have a method like "".insertViewsAt(idx, views)"" so one item (or more) can be prepended or inserted at specific locations without requiring the entire views collection to be re-bound and rendered.      This would also bring the ScrollableView control in line with ListView and TableView, both of which feature ""insert"" methods.    In my particular case; I'm using a ScrollableView to page through over 500 views which are fairly complex. Loading all views into the ScrollableView is not an option as that takes too much memory and crashes the app.  My solution is to have a sliding range that loads 9 views at a time (4 before and 4 after the current page) on the ScrollableView.  And as the user moves left or right, it dynamically prepends or appends more views as needed, removing views also from the opposite end so only 9 views are loaded at any given time. Appending with addView() works well (no need for setViews(), so no flickering), but prepending with the getViews()/update/setViews() process does not work well in these situations.  "

On Android, these events also fire when the window gains or loses focus, such as when the Home button is clicked or when the screen is unlocked.

We currently have no such indicator in Android, thus this is critical.    UPDATE: see PR in comment below. The PR added the selected and unselected tab events for Android, while not modifying focus and blur behavior to maintain app compatibility. In iOS, tab focus and blur were simply renamed to selected and unselected. These events function as expected, and have the benefit of being more appropriately named.  "

Preferred behaviour would be to be able to have a property `lineHeight`, and the methods `setLineHeight` and `getLineHeight`, on `Titanium.UI.Label` and `Titanium.UI.TextArea`.    LineHeight would be set to control the vertical spacing between lines in a multiline label or textarea.

Create and Configure Notification Actions  2. Create and assign Notification Actions to Notification Categories  3. Register the Notification Categories and Notification Types  4. After which, add event listeners for notifications received while the app is active, or in background.    *Detailed Steps:*  *1.

EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2,address=0xc)    Note: the line numbers might vary deepening on the SDK version, but they're close enough    The reason for this is very simple. When using Titanium Mobile we have two types of JS object: A normal JS object, and a JS object containing an Objective-C object.   When using a Hyperloop module, there's another JS object added to the equation, a JS object containing a Hyperloop object.  In JavaScriptCore every JS object has a place for a void*. In Titanium Mobile we store an Objective-C ""id"" directly there. In Hyperloop, in the other hand, we store a c++ class in that same void* property, and that class has a void* property (called ""data"") and there we sore an objective-c ""id"". This is why it crashes.    Titanium Mobile:  JS Object -> void* -> id  Hyperloop  JSObject -> void* -> c++ class -> void* -> id      In the first line of code we get the void* from the JS object and cast it as an ""id"". Then we call an Objective-C method on it - ""isKindOfClass:"".

Plus, using file.write(e.data) in this case takes too much time to run in the background. iOS only allows 30 seconds. Chances are the app will be either crashed or suspended before the file is saved.    I suggest: upon downloadcompleted move the file to a temp directory and return the path instead of a blob.       h4.

Problem Description  I found that attaching a 'swipe' event handler to a tab group with the goal of allowing swiping left and right to change tabs is having the unintended side effect of preventing the native scroll behavior on a table view contained in the tab group on Android.  Normally when you swipe down (fling) on a table view, there's some inertia and the table view keeps scrolling for a little bit. When there is a 'swipe' event handler on a tab group and you swipe down on a table view, as soon as you lift your finger off the screen the table view motion stops. There is no inertia. The scrolling stops as soon as the finger is lifted, making it hard to scroll through a long list.  iOS doesn't seem affected. The swipe handler works and native scroll works as expected.    h4.

Titanium is able to read an image file asynchronously into a buffer and then a blob. If we assign that blob to the image property of an ImageView, it displays as I expect.

"TIMOB-17572","Bug","iOS",5,"iOS: ActivityIndicator does not reset when used in ListView","A template in a ListView includes an ActivityIndicator. The first time the activity indicator appears, its spinner works fine but the second and subsequent time it appears, the spinner does not work.     Steps to reproduce:    (1) Create a new Alloy project and drop the three attached files into their usual folders and run the project on an iPhone or iOS Simulator.     (2) Scroll to the bottom. The ActivityIndicator appears as normal for a second, until it's replaced with more ListItems.    (3) Scroll to the bottom again. Now the ActivityIndicator is sans-spinner. Every subsequent scroll will have the same results.    It appears that this is because the ActivityIndicator view is not properly resetting when removed from the ListView. When I set visible=false to the ActivityIndicator before removing it from the view, the spinner works ok. Unfortunately this requires editing a ListView which is an expensive operation. You can see the workaround in action by uncommenting line 95 of the example code.    Note that the word ""Loading"" (also part of the ActivityIndicator) does appear even though the spinner does not."

"TIMOB-17613","Bug","Android",3,"Unable to execute javascript code using evalJS on Android with SDK 3.3.0.GA","After upgrading to the latest Titanium SDK (3.3.0.GA), we are not able to invoke Javascript functions using evalJS on Android. We are developing the application for about 2-3 years now, and we can confirm that the code worked prior upgrading to 3.3.0. Moreover, the iOS version of our app does not have this problem even after upgrading the SDK.  Our application is quite complex, and one of the core features is the integration with web applications provided by our platform. In order this integration to work, we heavily rely on invoking Javascript functions in the webView context in order to retrieve some data, or identify what steps should be taken.    Since we are not allowed to share any productive code, I have prepared a code snippet that presents the issue:    {code:title=app.js|borderStyle=solid}  (function() {      var win = Ti.UI.createWindow();   var webView = Ti.UI.createWebView({    url : 'test.html'   });      var evalJSFunc = """" +    ""(function() {"" +     ""var result = '{';"" +    ""var d = document.getElementById('myDiv');"" +    ""if (d && d.children) {"" +     ""var childrenLength = d.children.length;"" +     ""var delimiter = '';"" +     ""for (var i = 0; i < childrenLength; i++) {"" +      ""var child = d.children[i];"" +      ""result = result + delimiter + child.name + ':' + child.value;"" +      ""delimiter = ',';"" +     ""}"" +    ""}"" +    ""result = result + '}';"" +    ""return result + '}';"" +   ""})();"";      webView.addEventListener('load', function() {    var result = webView.evalJS(evalJSFunc);    alert(result);   });      win.add(webView);   win.open();     })();      When executing the above we get the following error:      After some time (if we wait enough) we get the attached screenshot in Genymotion simulator (no clue where this comes from).    Until now, the workaround for us was to rollback to the previous Titanium SDK (3.2.3.GA). Now, given the fact that Apple will also release the new iOS8 soon, we expect that new Titanium SDK would be rolled out as well, one that we must upgrade to, since iOS8 is a must for us. However, this Android issue is also a blocker, putting us in deadlock situation.  I have noticed that there are few other JIRA issues similar to ours.     https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-15896  https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TC-4427    However, I'm not sure if the cause is really the same (one of the issues says that this happens on 3.2.0 with API17 but we are experiencing it on 3.3.0 with API16). In either case, we would highly appreciate if this issue is treated with higher priority and resolved as quick as possible.    "

"TIMOB-17700","Bug","CLI",1,"CLI: Hitting the enter key after entering the data for CLI prompts in CLI setup wizard, does not take the cursor to next line","Description:    While doing some regression testing, I have come across an issue due to which I am unable to run number of CLI commands that takes input from user.  The issue is with hitting the enter key after giving the input data. Hitting the enter key will not take the cursor to next line.It is triggering a space on the terminal.Need to do CTR + c to come out of it.Hence not able to run some CLI commands like ti sdk select, ti setup, ti login etc.     Test machine details:  Initially the system had the setup  CLI 3.4.0-rc3 and titanium SDK 3.4.0.v20140915175720.  Then, I have  only switched CLI to CLI 3.3.0 version and titanium SDK remains the same 3.4.0.v20140915175720.  Run the CLI ""ti sdk select"" command and faced the above mentioned issue with hitting the enter key.    STEPS TO REPRODUCE:  1. Install CLI 3.4.0-rc3 and titanium SDK 3.4.0.v20140915175720 on machine.The ti SDK is set to 3.4.0.v20140915175720 with CLI.  2.

Run ""ti sdk select"" command and choose the required sdk and hit the enter key.Make sure you are having more than one ti SDK installed on your system.  5. Run ""ti login"" command and enter the user name and hit the enter key.    EXPECTED RESULT:  3. The cursor should go to next line and CLI will prompt for the next input data.  4. The required SDK configuration should be set.  5. The cursor moves to next line and CLI should prompt for the password.    ACTUAL RESULT:  3. Hitting the enter key, triggers a space on terminal and not able to go to next prompt.  4. Hitting the enter key triggers a space and does not set the configured sdk.  5. Hitting the enter key does not take the cursor to next line for password prompt.Instead the enter key triggers a space on terminal.    Please refer the attached screenshots.  The issue is reproducible with other machines as well.    I have uninstalled the CLI and all the titanium sdk versions installed on my system.  Then freshly installed only titanium SDK 3.4.0.v20140915175720 and CLI 3.4.0-rc3.

I found it strange that it was crashing, because this code was working just a few days ago, and the module had not been changed, nor had I really done anything to the app and the way it handles ImageViews.    I scoured android source code, tweets, and forum posts, and I've learned that in android 4.4, Square's okhttp code is supposedly incorporated into HttpUrlConnection.  However, I've never found any code for com.android.okhttp.HttpResponseCache.  The only code I can find is for com.squareup.okhttp.HttpResponseCache, not ""com.android"".      com.squareup.okhttp.HttpResponseCache extends java.net.ResponseCache, just like TiResponseCache does.  But the code in TiResponseCache.peek() is only expecting to get back a TiResponseCache object when it calls getDefault().  Changing that might not be trivial, since it depends on the cacheDir member variable of the returned object, and that's not part of the java.net.ResponseCache class.    Here's what I think has happened -- google released Google Play Services 6.1.09 on September 23, 2014.  It automatically updated on my device.  Inside the new Google Play Services is a call to ResponseCache.setDefault(), and they're setting that default to a com.android.okhttp.HttpResponseCache object.    Titanium assumes that the default system ResponseCache is the one that it set in TiApplication.java, and it doesn't handle things well when somebody else messes with the default.      I don't know what the fix is for this -- I'll leave that to the android platform experts in your employ.  But I think it is a critical issue, and will become more obvious in the coming days as this Play Services update propagates.  Any app that is using Google Play Services (or at least the DFP portion of it) and the TiDownloadManager will crash.  "

The issue is not that the prompt never shows but that its only triggered by launching the camera. If I want to prompt the user before I launch the camera there is no way to prompt the user.     We would like to request the following features for Titanium 3.5.0 SDK:   1. Calling isCameraSupported() triggers the camera allowed prompt   2. If the user says Don't Allow calling isCameraSupported() again should return false, but its returning true which is incorrect.     h6.Steps to reproduce  # Build attached sample with environment specification  # On the device go to settings > general > scroll to bottom, reset > reset Location & privacy   # Launch the app and,  # Click ""is Camera supported"" button   # Notice that it returns 1 which is true   # Click Launch Camera (Notice that a prompt is shown asking for access to the camera.   # Click Dont allow   # Take a picture and accept it   # Notice that the picture is black   # Accept the picture   # Click is Camera Supported   # Notice that it returns 1 which is true.     h6.Notes  The user did not allow camera access so the isCameraSupported should return false. Also the prompt to enable camera access should be triggered by the isCameraSupported call or some other call so that we can ask the user if they want to allow camera access before we launch the camera.     Following my steps on step 4 isCameraSupported() returns a 1 that it is supported, and no prompt is shown.     Then if you go to step 6 and launch image capture the prompt shows up but at that point the camera is being launched. We need to be able to trigger the prompt on the isCameraSupported call.     Now in step 7 click the Dont Allow button and take a picture of the black area, notice its black. Now accept or close the image capture viewfinder. Click as stated in step 11 isCameraSupported(). Notice that its still a 1 which indicates that the camera is supported even though the user has not allowed access.     "

However, exitOnClose closes the app even when the window is closed programatically. The app should be closed only when back is pressed on the window, as written in the doc. There is little sense in closing an app programmatically.    Here is a problematic (but fairly typical) scenario:  1. First time user entry opens login window  2. After login app opens win1  3. Normally, pressing ""back"" on win 1 should close the app (win1.exitOnClose = true)  4. If logged in at entry, the login page is not opened, and the app opens win1. Again, win1.exitOnClose = true usually does the job  5. However, if the user elects to ""logout"" from the app (e.g. logout menu item on win1), then win1 should close (win1.close() called) and the login window should open. But if win1 closes and exitOnClose == true, then the logout closes the app completely.    Thus, exitOnClose should function for the back button only. Alternatively, exitOnClose can be a dynamic property: win1 in this case will normally have exitOnClose == true, but in case of a logout event win1.exitOnClose should be set to false."

"TIMOB-17868","Bug","Windows",8,"Windows: Investigate necessity of protect() and unprotect() usage","protect() and unprotect() should be unnecessary for the developer to call directly, but there seem to be some cases where they appear to be required. We need to understand the reasons they are used, and upgrade the infrastructure to remove that necessity.    You need to ensure that `Ti.UI.createAlertDialog` API is exposed, so please copy and paste this into the `TiUIModule.cpp` js string:      You also need to remove the protect/unprotect() calls inside AlertDialog.    Here's the test, and steps to reproduce: (code under steps)    1. Click on the button  2. See the alert dialog  3. Click on any of the two buttons in less than one second since shown  At this point you will see something is the console log  4. Repeat set number 3 but this time wait over a second    At this point the log will not show.        Explanation:    Since the `protect` and `unprotect` have been removed, the alert dialog proxy will die when garbage collection is called. In the button event listener we're calling GC (for testing purposes only) after one second. If you click on the button before GC, you're saved and the event listener of the alert is called. If you wait for the GC to be called, the event listener is not called.    The `share_ptr` is likely hiding a bug. In the ""click"" event handler of the alert's button (native event handler), we're checking if the proxy is still alive or not, and if it's not, we just ignore the callback to avoid a crash. But we need to realize that the native alert object and its buttons may still alive. And the question is, when will the native alert and its buttons be release from memory?    This is the reason for a `protect` and `unprotect` in the alert dialog proxy. I added the `protect` and `unprotect` back to test, and everything will go back to normal."

Tab focus/blur should be removed since we have selected/unselected which are much clearer, and since it makes no sense for tabs to be focused/blurred. Focus/blur events should occur on the Window or perhaps on the entire tab group, but not for ""tabs"" which are only used for selection and are not really a containing UI element. Note that for Android tab focus/blur fire in numerous cases, not just tab selection, and in all ""relevant"" cases we have Window focus/blur in any case so for tabs they're redundant."

With Apple now having acquired the Testflight platform and incorporating it into their iTunes Connect platform, it is time to separate these two keys and to use them properly.

Unfortunately, we cannot use this as a workaround, as the view structure we need to build for the actual app needs the scrollableView to be in a container with other views, or to be set up without the vertical layout.

I anticipate that having this ability would reduce the number of different build environments that we would have to maintain and would allow us to upgrade our Android versions at a faster pace.     The request would be to select the Android Build Tools version when launching the ti build command via a parameter.     h6.Use Case  The scenario is as follows. Suppose we have a app 3.4 which is GA'd against the 3.4.1.GA TiSDK Android-18 Target SDK, and the Android 19.1.0 Build Tools. We are now working on our app 3.5 project and want to upgrade to TI 3.5.0.GA and the Android Target SDK to 21 for Android 5.0 support. For Android 5.0 support we have to use build tools 21.0.0.

I used to run it using      .../3.5.0.GA/titanium.py run        but that doesn't work anymore, instead I run      {quote}  python build.py  {quote}      which works although it will not run in simulator which adds up to development time.    the thing is that when I tried    {quote}  xcrun lipo -info build/...... .a  {quote}    I only got i386        so I had to recreate a new module using the new titanium CLI, change the GUID and add my objective c classes and Google framework setup guide to it.    then after building again I managed to get it to support all architectures, so you may want to update the docs for veteran module developers.        now for the main issue:    I use the module in a 10 lines demo app which just opens a window and adds an instance of Google  maps, I build it with 3.4.1.GA SDK and it runs fine in the simulator. I also used the latest 1.9.1 version of Google's framework    I then simply changed the tiapp.xml to use 3.5.0.GA instead, the simulator opened, I see my debug printouts and then the app crashes, according to xcode it crashes due to a memory release that was not allocated.     {quote}  malloc: *** error for object 0xffcb5f0: pointer being freed was not allocated ***  *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug  {quote}    I tried to set the above breakpoint, I tried to see the xcode stack when it crashes but it is of no use, it crashes somewhere in the tile drawing of the Google Maps framework but it will not do so if run through SDK 3.4.1.GA...      Fact is, that from all the components used here the only variable that changed is the Titanium SDK version. so my guess is something in the list of changes of the new SDK broke something and some of the older apps won't work anymore. This module is used by many Titanium developers and is bundled with their published apps.        to sum up:    1. module + SDK 3.4.1.GA + Google SDK 1.9.1 = works  2. module + SDK 3.5.0.GA + Google SDK 1.9.1 = crash  3. xCode project + Google SDK 1.9.1 + sample app = works  4. older module build compiled months ago + SDK 3.5.0.GA = crash        attached is a sample project. it has a module folder with three versions, the 1.9.3 was built with 3.5.0.GA and supports 64-bit, the rest are older 32-bit only created with older SDKs (3.4.0 and earlier)      you will need to get the Google SDK    {quote}  https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/  {quote}    you will also need to tell the module where to find the google framework in the module.xcconfig file per the module docs        if you need a license key for it drop me an email : canufind1 at gmail"

"TIMOB-18515","New Feature","iOS",3,"iOS: TabGroup - Support UIEdgeInsets for Tab items so we can have Instagram-like tabs with only images","The default native way to make a custom (image only) tab bar (like the one on instagram) is to use UIEdgeInsets so we can reposition the image inside the Tab when it has no title text.    The best way for making this happen on Titanium is mapping a method and properties, allowing developers to set the Tab Item Insets for the Tab bar image (both for regular as for active images).    There is a property on UIBarItem (UIBarButton item inherits from this class) called imageInsets.    {code:objectivec}  tabBarItem.imageInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(6, 0, -6, 0);  {code}    I suggest a Ti method on the Tab object named setImageInsets() in which developers can pass the absolute values for image insets and properly realign images inside the tabs. It would be ideal to have the imageInsets property as well so we can instance the tabs with the proper insets avoiding rendering flicks.    This is the best way to have a native tab bar without using the actual solutions of hiding the tab bar and creating a bunch of custom views on the bottom of the app or using unmaintained modules.

Create a new file in Resources directory and name it suds2.js and paste the following code taken from the source mentioned above:  {code:title=/Resources/suds2.js|borderStyle=solid}  /*jslint maxerr:1000 */  /**  * *  * Sud2 is forked from Kevin Whinnery's suds.js project  * Updates to Suds2 can be found at https://github.com/benbahrenburg/Suds2  *   * Suds: A Lightweight JavaScript SOAP Client  * Copyright: 2009 Kevin Whinnery (http://www.kevinwhinnery.com)  * License: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html  * Source: http://github.com/kwhinnery/Suds  */  var SudsClient = function(_options) {        //A generic extend function - thanks MooTools    function extend(original, extended) {      for (var key in (extended || {})) {        if (original.hasOwnProperty(key)) {          original[key] = extended[key];        }      }      return original;    }      function endWith(str,suffix){    str = str +'';    var lastIndex = str.lastIndexOf(suffix);       return (lastIndex != -1) && (lastIndex + suffix.length == str.length);    };          //Check if an object is an array    function isArray(obj) {      return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj) == '[object Array]';    }        //Grab an XMLHTTPRequest Object    function getXHR() {       return Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient({          validatesSecureCertificate : false,          timeout: 5000       });    }        //Parse a string and create an XML DOM object    function xmlDomFromString(_xml) {      var xmlDoc = Titanium.XML.parseString(_xml);      return xmlDoc;    };        // Convert a JavaScript object to an XML string - takes either an    function convertToXml(_obj, namespacePrefix) {      var xml = '';      if (isArray(_obj)) {        for (var i = 0; i < _obj.length; i++) {          xml += convertToXml(_obj[i], namespacePrefix);        }      } else {        //For now assuming we either have an array or an object graph        for (var key in _obj) {          if (namespacePrefix && namespacePrefix.length) {            xml += '<' + namespacePrefix + ':' + key + '>';          } else {            xml += '<'+key+'>';          }          if (isArray(_obj[key]) || (typeof _obj[key] == 'object' && _obj[key] != null)) {            xml += convertToXml(_obj[key]);          }          else {            xml += _obj[key];          }          if (namespacePrefix && namespacePrefix.length) {            xml += '</' + namespacePrefix + ':' + key + '>';          } else {            xml += '</'+key+'>';          }        }      }      return xml;    }        // Client Configuration    var config = extend({      endpoint:'http://localhost',      targetNamespace: 'http://localhost',      envelopeBegin: '<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?><soap:Envelope xmlns:ns0=""PLACEHOLDER"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"" xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/""><soap:Body>',      envelopeEnd: '</soap:Body></soap:Envelope>',      headerBegin: '<soap:Header>',      headerNode:'head',      headerEnd: '</soap:Header>',      timeout : 5000,      includeNS : true,      addTargetSchema : false,      ns:'ns0'    },_options);        function wrapNS(nsOnly){     if(config.includeNS){      return ((nsOnly) ?

Add this code to the app.js file:     {code:title=/Resources/app.js|borderStyle=solid}  var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({   backgroundColor: 'white'  });    var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({  });    var config = {   endpoint:""https://cajanet.com:9443/CajaAhorro/services/WebServiceImpl?wsdl"",      targetNamespace: 'http://services.data.cajaAhorro.isi.com.mx',       includeNS : false,      addTargetSchema : true   };    var sudsModule = require('suds2');    var sudsClient = new sudsModule(config);  sudsClient.invoke('logOff', {strClaveUsu: 19844},   function(xmlDoc) {              Ti.API.info(""Response "" + xmlDoc);       label.text = xmlDoc;         return;   }  );    win.add(label);  win.open();  {code}    5. Run the project.     You should be able to see the response XML in the label added to the window showing that the code is working.    6. To reproduce the timeout error just change the sdk to a newer one, let's say 3.5.0 and run the project again.    You will see this error on the console:    {code:javascript}  {""type"":""error"",""source"":{""url"":""https://cajanet.com:9443/CajaAhorro/services/WebServiceImpl?wsdl"",""method"":""POST"",""timeout"":5000,""validatesSecureCertificate"":false},""code"":-1001,""error"":""The request timed out."",""success"":false}  {code}    I created a [question about this problem|https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/181272/httpclient-not-working-for-ios-after-sdk-330-for-consuming-a-soap-service-over-https] in the forum too because I finished all my resources looking for an answer.    I attached a project with all the resources described above.    Please consider to take a look at this, I know that SOAP and XML sucks but it's not my fault that my client's infrastructure is built on this.     Thank you for your time."

We fire off requests in tests and continue on and eventually in a a later test (typically the layout suite) we'll get an error stemming from the HTTPClient firing an onreadystatechange callback:        It's in HTTPClient::onreadystatechange in Titaniumkit, where it's testing if the callback is a function. The issue is likely because we've long moved on from the test where the httpclient was generated - I'm thinking maybe it was GCed and we didn't properly cancel and clean up in our destructor.    The request was continuing in an async chain. My best guess is that we need to cancel all outstanding requests when the Windows impl desturctor hits, and null out the callback objects up in the TitaniumKit destructor?"

"TIMOB-18956","Bug","Android",8,"Android orientation change detection is missing reverse orientation distinction","The documentation confirms that this is missing from the various places where in Android you could detect orientation change.    * Ti.Gesture.orientationchange event http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Gesture-event-orientationchange     * Ti.Gesture.orientation property http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Gesture-property-orientation     * Ti.Android.Activity. requestedOrientation property http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Android.Activity-property-requestedOrientation    From docs:  On Android and Mobile Web, returns the orientation of the current window, and *never reports the ""reverse"" orientations* (LANDSCAPE_RIGHT and UPSIDE_PORTRAIT).    Android itself does report the reverse orientation changes, Titanium is just not surfacing this level of reporting.     This deficiency prevents being able to detect precisely to which orientation has the device been rotated to with respect to a view, such as a camera view needed for barcode scanning. When the device has rotated but the view (and the object which is the subject of the scanning) has not rotated, you must be able to determine what the relative rotation is without the possibility of being 180 degrees off.    Let me try to illustrate how this becomes a problem with some ASCII art and the scenario being a barcode scanning camera view in a module where the app must report to the module the orientation change. This is just an example of 1 use case where this deficiency can be seen as a problem.     Let's say this is your device in portrait orientation:        ABCD are the corners of the hardware, abcd are the corners of the camera view. Let's say the camera sensor is mounted such that the top-left corner of the picture is nearest to the A corner, the top-right corner of the picture is nearest to the B corner, etc. In this case, the rotation difference between the camera sensor and the camera view is 0 degrees, so the pixel at the top-left corner of the picture can go near the 'a' corner of the view, the pixel at the top-right corner of the picture can go near the 'b' corner of the view, etc.    If the activity supports landscape-right orientation, then this is how your screen will look like if you rotate your device 90 degrees counter-clockwise:        The important thing to realize is that the camera sensor rotated with the hardware but the view didn't, and neither did the object you are pointing the camera at. So the top-left pixel is still near the A corner as far as the camera sensor is concerned, but now that pixel needs to go to the 'c' corner of the view, otherwise from your (the user's) perspective the camera feed will look like it's rotated 90 degrees clockwise (because the object in front of the camera didn't rotate with the camera sensor).    This can be achieved by the app telling the module that the activity's UI is now in landscape-right orientation, which the module will interpret not as landscape-right per se, rather as ""rotate the camera feed 90 degrees counter-clockwise"".    I think by now it should be clear why we need to distinguish between landscape-right and landscape-left, but just for completeness -- if the activity supports landscape-left orientation as well, then this is how your screen will look like if you rotate your device 90 degrees clockwise (relative to portrait):        The top-left pixel is still near the A corner as far as the camera sensor is concerned, but now that pixel needs to go to the 'b' corner of the view. In this case the module would have to rotate the camera feed clockwise by 90 degrees. If we can't distinguish between these two cases (i.e. landscape-left and landscape-right), then the best we can do is to rotate the camera feed by 90 degrees in the same direction in both cases, which will mean that the camera feed will appear off by 180-degrees (i.e. upside-down) to the user in one of those cases.    Similar logic applies to portrait vs. reversePortrait.    A work around would be to recreate orientation change handling in the module, however the better solution should be to improve this handling in the Titanium SDK  so that the app can notify the module using Titanium SDK available functions/events about this change instead of the module needing to unnecessarily replicate Titanium SDK capabilities just to improve them.    This works as expected in the iOS Titanium SDK."

"TIMOB-19000","Improvement","iOS|Tooling",8,"Remove Titanium build call from Xcode pre-compile phase","A long time ago, Titanium's iOS build was written in Python. The iOS build performed 3 major steps:    # Create all Xcode related files in build dir  # Run xcodebuild to compile project, which in turn fires the Xcode project's pre-compile phase script that calls the iOS build again to copy the Titanium-specific resources  # Xcode builds the final app and signs it    It was done this way so that you could open the generated Xcode project, modify JS files, and build from Xcode.    When we replaced they Python-based iOS build scripts with the Node.js version, there was a performance issue with Xcode calling the Titanium CLI to copy the Titanium resources. I changed things so that if you are building from the Titanium CLI, it would copy the Xcode project related files, then the Titanium related files, then finally call xcodebuild. This significantly sped things up.    The problem today is that when you run {{appc run}}, it generates a Xcode project who's pre-compile script references the Titanium CLI. Users do not have the Titanium CLI installed by default and thus it will fail. Even if they did, the encryption method would vary. Also the Xcode project's pre-compile should be calling the {{appc run}}, not {{ti build}}.    I'm proposing we remove the Xcode project's pre-compile script.    Pros:  * Remove cruft from the iOS build  ** There's a lot of code that accommodates the ability for Titanium resources to be processed when building from Xcode that we could rip out  ** As maintainers of the iOS build changes, not all of the knowledge is transferred and thus new contributors neglect the Xcode-specific build path  * Speeds up builds when building from Xcode  * Building from Xcode only really works when you have Titanium CLI installed  * Building via {{appc run}} encrypts differently than {{ti build}} and thus building from Xcode would render the new encrypted files unused and bloat the app  * Modifying Titanium JS files and building directly from Xcode is not officially supported    Cons:  * Deprecates a feature that has existed for years"

Quote from link  {quote}  Three steps all developers can take to make sure their applications work over IPv6 networks:  - Use the networking frameworks (for example, “NSURLSession”)  - Avoid use of IPv4-specific APIs  - Avoid hard-coded IP addresses    Essentially, if app developers are using the higher level APIs and frameworks and aren’t hacking around at the IP layer, their apps should probably “just work” on top of either IPv4 or IPv6.  This is an important point – most iOS developers probably do not need to do anything on the development side. Assuming they have followed best practices in coding and are using the iOS networking frameworks, they should be all set.  Some developers, though, may be using lower level APIs that may involve direct usage of IPv4 addresses. Some developers may also be using the user’s IPv4 address as an identifier or for logging or configuration purposes.

Depending on your luck, you will either get no error or a file rename error. pngcrush returns 0 if crushing fails, which is probably a bug with pngcrush (or at least the one shipped with Xcode 7). The rename error happens because pngcrush take the input file and writes the crushed png to another file and the iOS build needs to rename it back to the correct filename. If the temporary crushed png image was never generated, then there's nothing to rename and then it blows up.    It's worth noting that in Titanium SDK 4.x and older, the iOS build called {{/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin/iphoneos-optimize}}. This is a perl script that converts plists into binary format and crushes pngs. The problem with this script is if pngcrush fails, it aborts the entire script and returns 0. This is bad.

The same code works correctly on SDK 4.1.0 GA.    The data object that is sent to HTTPClient looks like this:        Where {{imageData}} is a photo selected from the device.      On the server, it seemed like the imageData was coming through, but nothing else: {{entry.id}}, {{_eventName}}, {{caption}}, and {{fileName}} were no populated on my server-side form.    In an effort to help debug the issue, I dumped the ""raw"" incoming POST data to the server console.  The results looked something like this:                I immediately saw the problem.  Note how for the non-binary fields, such as {{_eventName}} at the top, the right quote is missing at the end of the name value.      This explains why my web framework was unable to correctly populate the data model with the form data; it was unable to read it due to the missing double quote.    This is a new regression from 4.1.0.  It works correctly if I use the 4.1.0 SDK.    For those who are seeing this bug, one possible work around is to convert the file to be  uploaded to a base64 encoded string.  This is how my example from above updated to use a base64 encoded string:          Of course, this only works if you also control the server-side and can handle the base64 encoded file appropriately.

If not, then I'd say we rename {{cardBackgroundColor}} to {{backgroundColor}}.        *UPDATE:* I'm not convinced deviating from standard properties like [backgroundColor|https://appcelerator.github.io/appc-docs/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.View-property-backgroundColor], [borderRadius|https://appcelerator.github.io/appc-docs/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.View-property-borderRadius], [elevation|https://appcelerator.github.io/appc-docs/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.View-property-elevation] and [*Padding|https://appcelerator.github.io/appc-docs/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.TextField-property-paddingLeft].    * *Pro:* Easier to translate what you read in the [Android reference|https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/CardView.html] to your Titanium app.  * *Con:* Titanium developers are used to our naming conventions throughout what is after all a cross-platform SDK, even for platform-specific components.    Given my experience that most Titanium developers do not read the target platform references but rely on our docs and - lazy as developers are - the predictability of our API I think we should:    * Remove the {{card}} prefix from the CardView specific properties.  * Rename {{(card)CornerRadius}} to {{borderRadius}}.  * Remove the {{content}} prefix from the {{contentPadding*}} properties."

As an example, we'd get a DisplayListCanvas (a subclass of Canvas) in a subclass of View's onDraw method. That type isn't in the android.jar and we have no means of trying to get it's details without the android source code. the method declares the param type as simply Canvas.    As  a hedge against this, when we wrap arguments or return types, we hold the object and it's specific subclass on the Java side, but report as and wrap with the declared type.

You have to force close and then re-open the app for it to work again.  * The response for {{requestLocationPermissions}} also has {{authorizationStatus}}, which would be very useful to have in the response for the others as well.  * On success, the response for {{requestLocationPermissions}} has an empty string for {{error}} where it should either have a message or be undefined.  * When unknown, {{requestContactsPermissions}} has a not very helpful _Access Denied_ {{error}} instead of just being undefined like {{Calendar}} and {{Camera}}.  * Unless permission was granted, the {{error}} for {{requestLocationPermissions}} is always _The user is unable to allow access to location._, which is not very helpful or even misleading since the user is perfectly able, he just denied permission to the app. Calendar and Contacts have better error messages.  * When denied, the response for {{requestCameraPermissions}} has no {{error}} like the others.  * I have no idea where {{code}} comes from but if I deny it (probably by coincidence) correctly maps to {{AUTHORIZATION_DENIED}} for Calendar and Contacts. Would be helpful to have the meaning of this code documented.  * In iOS 8, denying contacts permission sends success response to callback.     h2.

This might be related to [https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TC-5837]    I've tested this with Titanium SDK 5.1.2 & 5.2.0 on Android 4, 5 and 6 devices. For testing I limited my wireless link speed with dd-wrt to 64kbits. This is also reproducable with slow mobile EDGE speeds.    The example code uses a 1 MB testfile from here: [http://cachefly.cachefly.net/speedtest/]    {code:javascript}     var win = Ti.UI.createWindow();   var progress = Ti.UI.createProgressBar({    width:200,    min:0,    max:1,    value:0,    });   win.add(progress);     var timestamp = Date.now();   var file = Ti.Filesystem.getFile('1mb.test');     win.addEventListener('open', function() {    var xhr = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({     onload: function() {      var time_passed =  Math.floor((Date.now()-timestamp)/1000);      Ti.API.info(time_passed + ' SUCCESS');     },     onsendstream: function(e) {      var time_passed =  Math.floor((Date.now()-timestamp)/1000);      Ti.API.info(time_passed + ' PROGRESS ' + e.progress);      progress.setValue(e.progress);     }    });    xhr.open('POST', 'http://www.example.org/post.php');    xhr.send({data: file})   });   win.open();    {code}    *What should happen:*  The link speed IS constant, so the progress log should be liniear. Assuming a BLANK response, the onload event should get called quickly after progress reached the value of 1.    *What actually happens:*  Progress goes up to value 1 very quickly (in 1-2 seconds). It's not possible to upload 1MB in ~1 second with the available bandwidth. The progress is not fired anymore after it reached the value of 1 although the upload is still in progress. After ~138 seconds the onload event fires correctly. The time of the onload event is consistent with the available bandwith. Router bandwith logs show also that a upload is in progress until the onload event is fired.        "

"TIMOB-23114","Bug","iOS",8,"iOS: Fonts issues on iOS 9","h3. I'm using the latest SDK but this issue has been there since the release of San Francisco font. First of all, the semibold weight doesn't work, it renders a normal (regular) font (I think it would be a good idea for Titanium to support more weights, this is very limited for people who care a lot about UI)  Second thing, the system font on iOS (San francisco) is a dynamic font, it uses custom tracking for different font sizes, this is also not working, the tracking is always 0. Even when I try to embed the font and use it as a custom font, all font weights work but none of the tracking is applied which causes a not so good font display.   I don't know if this helps, but if you want to see the difference between properly rendered fonts and wrongly rendered ones, you can try using any constant of the textStyle, they render perfectly well.

So far, so good.    If however, like I did in my project, you manually set remoteBackup = true or call setRemoteBackup(true) on a file to doubly make sure it gets backed up, it actually becomes excluded.    I've had reports from users that their copy of my app (live on the App Store) was not fully restoring their data from a backup. The files I'd set the flag = true on were some .png's in /Documents and a SQLite database in /Library/Private Documents, but I think the problem is evident for any files.    I delved into the SDK code for 5.2.1 and located remoteBackup in TiFilesystemFileProxy.m - after a bit of Googling I noticed that how the method works by calling   {code:java}  setxattr()  {code}   is now obsolete. Apple states that from iOS 5.1 you should be doing it this way: [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1719/_index.html]    I modified my copy of TiFilesystemFileProxy.m to work this way and next time I called setRemoteBackup(true) the file was properly marked for backup, i.e. {{NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey}} is set to {{NO}}.    I tested this against a local iTunes backup. You can check the contents of an iTunes backup using the Terminal command:       Prior to my temporary Obj-C code fix my files were not listed in the backup. After adding my fix the files were listed in the backup correctly.  "

We were notified by Google that our app built with SDK version 5.1.2.GA has a security vulnerability. Appcelerator support recommended upgrading to 5.2.1.GA.     During upgrade, we found that the Trusteer custom module failed to load during startup causing app crash. See below for the error log. We found that the issue exists in version 5.2.2.GA as well.     Since it's working with 5.1.2.GA, we assume that something changed in the newer SDK versions broke the module.     h6.Steps to Reproduce  1. Create a sample Alloy or Classic App.  2. Paste the below code into the app.js file.  3. Add the attached module.  4. Run on iOS device or simulator.      h6. Expected behaviour  Since it works on Ti SDK - 5.1.2. It should works on later version.      h6.

"TIMOB-23433","Bug","Android",1,"Android: Background service loses activity context and properties when restarted","For a long time we have been using a background service backed up with a alarm manger to implement a reoccurring service that runs some code and talks to a backend. This is a very common thing to do. To develop this feature according to google guide lines the use of a alarm manager is required to avoid having the service die due to different Android SDK limitations in power schemes and standby. Over time (2 years) I have seen Android 4, 5 and now 6 implement harsher and more restricted limitations on services.     Too make sure a service is kept alive after a shutdown of the app for what ever reason you use the START_STICKY option to make the service restart. This is to make sure the service restarts if the main app (activity) is shut down by the user or by the system. The START_STICKY option makes the service restart regardless of the main app (activity)    Along with this setting the Alarm manager will make sure to reenable/ restart the service if for any reason the Android system shut down the service for battery or other standby / doze reasons.    For the moment we have a service running as expected when it comes to these settings and issues, however for a long time we have seen that the service that are restarted loses its original inheritance from the main app. For instance if you make an app and a service (see your own docs) the service can access the Alloy.Globals properties as long as the service is not restarted. This is most probably due to the fact that the service (thread) inherits the main apps memory area. This is at least how a Linux system would work. So far all good, but now if the service is restarted from a START_STYCKY setting, making sure that the service stays aline even if the main app (activity) is killed the service can no longer use the Alloy.Globals.     We have of course worked around this by require the Alloy framework, however that will not solve the variables to come back, we also have to reinitiate them and set them ""again"" to make sure they are available everytime the service is restarted.    Over time we have however found a problem we cannot solve without having to patch your SDK every time and at all code lines where you use it.    In many many places in your code of the SDK you use something like:    public boolean hasLocationPermissions()   {    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 23) {     return true;    }    Activity currentActivity  = TiApplication.getInstance().getCurrentActivity();    if (currentActivity.checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {     return true;    }     return false;   }    this is found in the file: and at the latest nightly builds    android/modules/geolocation/src/java/ti/modules/titanium/geolocation/GeolocationModule.java    As you can see you are using the : Activity currentActivity  = TiApplication.getInstance().getCurrentActivity();    the problem is this is available when the service is still alive and inherited from main context, then the service is restarted the .getCurrentActivity is not available anymore, instead you have to use:    .getApplicationContext    So for every API that you have and use the TiApplication.getInstance().getCurrentActivity(); it means that the service in Android will crash, we have made some initial searches i your SDK and you use the TiApplication.getInstance().getCurrentActivity(); everywhere.     To make the service remain working using the common APIs that can be run in a background service like location above you have to change all these lines of code into .getApplicationContext    Now this is a CRITICAL VERY HIGH PRIO problem as this means (unless we are wrong) that no service in android can remain active when the main app is shut down and using START_STICKY is very common and the right way to use a service in the background, as well as using Alarm manager.    We also found the same problem here: ndroid/modules/platform/src/java/ti/modules/titanium/platform/PlatformModule.java  also an API that is a must in the background service, that one uses : Activity a = getActivity();    There are more.    We have had to patch EVERY API to have our Service continue service after the more and more common doze and standby along with limitations from the system. This is a none wanted situation and should be quite critical to you too making sure the community and professionals can use the backgrund service continually.     The last problem we encountered was that you probably use the same lines of code in your Analytics proprietary module making the Analytics to effectively crash in the service when used after a restart of the service, this also is a BIG problem as you want the analytics to report as well as not crashing the app. Here we havd to go into the SDK and remove the call to the Analytics module.. since we cant patch that code.    Can we PLEASE have some attention to this serious bug in Android and sort this thing out.    I do not have the time to make a example app of this right now but may help you later, just make sure to make a background service that uses START_STICKY and then kill the main app in the monitor (DDMS) observe the service restart (you do not have to use Alarm Manager as well) and then make sure you use one API that uses that getCurrentActivity call and you will see the service stop running..."

You can't swipe to the next or previous image in the set. The view bounces a bit, but won't scroll. No log output or errors are seen in the console.

"TIMOB-23476","Bug","Android",5,"Android: constants are writable","Constants in Android are able to be ""overwritten"". Things like Ti.App.EVENT_ACCESSIBILITY_ANNOUNCEMENT should be truly constant and the user shouldn't be able to overwrite the value or delete the property.    Currently you can ""overwrite"" the value:    '    I think the underlying cause here is actually different than TIMOB-23475. I Believe this is because we hang 'constants' on the prototype of the proxy (i.e. {{Object.getPrototypeOf(Ti.App);}}) while the global object living at {{Ti.App}} is an instance. So what's happening looks to be ""property shadowing"" where we're actually adding a new {{EVENT_ACCESSIBILITY_ANNOUNCEMENT}} property with our own value onto the instance of {{Ti.App}} that lives in the global namespace at {{Ti.App}}. This instance property ""shadows"" the original constant declared on the prototype.    To prove my point, calling Object.getPrototypeOf(Ti.App) gives:    You can clearly see the constants there.    It makes sense to hang the constants at the ""prototype"" level since they're supposed to be ""class-level/static"" constants and we shouldn't need to have every instance hold a copy. However, it looks like we're not preventing shadowing properly (even though it appears we're setting the constant property attributes to ReadOnly|DontDelete).    See https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/issues/91 for discussion on cases where there seems to be prevented shadowing.    One possible solution may be to do an Object.seal() on all our proxies after they're set up. This marks all properties as DontDelete and prevents new properties from being added."

Even if the framework is placed in the expected location, the app will crash upon execution.  Details provided below.    I discovered this issue while trying to use a swift Cocoapod, but it is easily reproduced using the Hyperloop_Sample app as well.  I will describe steps to reproduce for both cases.    1. For Hyperloop_Sample, simply add `use_frameworks!` to the beginning of Podfile and change the platform to 8.0 (frameworks only supported in iOS 8+).  Change the min-ios-ver to 8.0 in tiapp.xml as well.  As expected, instead of creating static libraries, frameworks for each pod are created instead.  These can be seen inside of `build/Release-iphonesimulator`.  The first issue comes during linking.  The framework is expected to be at `build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator` as seen in the attached build log (see Sample.log), search for GLCalendarView to see the expected location of the framework on line 4466.  I then tried manually copying the 3 frameworks from `build/Release-iphonesimulator` to `build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator` which allows the app to be built, but when it runs on the simulator, immediately crashes, see the attached crash log (Sample.crash).  I'm not real sure what the problem is, just that the error is ""Library not loaded"" for reason ""image not found"".    2. Next, I created a new project, enabled hyperloop, then tried to use a swift cocoapod.  Swift pods require use of `use_frameworks!`, so without this issue being resolved, we will be unable to use any swift pods.  I've attached my Podfile (see Podfile).  I tried building without referencing the pod in the Podfile, just to test, and while the app builds, it crashes as well, see (swift.crash)."

This is obviously not the right behavior.    It seems like the CallBack function for push notification is not called in this case; we are using Single Call Back.
