"TIDOC-2621","New Feature","Guides",3,"Document debugging iOS apps with 3rd-party tools","# Debugging iOS Apps with 3rd-party tools  No matter the route you take, you'll need to be sure you're using the included jscore framework option first.    ## Turn on use-jscore-framework  The key is to turn on the ""use-jscore-framework"" option in your tiapp.xml.  ```xml  <tiapp>  ...    <ios>  ...      <use-jscore-framework>true</use-jscore-framework>  ...    </ios>  ...  </tiapp>  ```    Once enabled, this will force Titanium to use the pre-packaged JSCore framework/engine as the Javascript engine internally (rather than our older TiCore framework, which is a mdofiied version of JSCore).    Since iOS 7, the pre-packaged JScore framework has contained a debugging agent and protocol using webinspectord. We make use of this service/protocol with our newest iOS debugger in Titanium 6, as does Safari in it's tooling.    ## Debugging with Safari DevTools  Be sure to turn on use-jscore-framework as shown above first.    ### Launch the app on device or simulator    Simply launch your application via Studio, or the command line:  ```bash  appc run -p ios  ```    /!\ Be sure to connect your device by the USB cord first, if debugging on device.    ### Enabled Develop menu in Safari  Now open Safari and ensure you have the **Develop** menu enabled to appear. You can enable it from Safari's Preferences > Advanced.    ![Show Develop menu in menu bar](enabled_develop_safari.png ""Show Develop menu in menu bar"")    ### Connect to the app  Once the app is up and running, you can connect the debugger by:  - Simulator: **Safari > Developer > Simulator > JSContext**  - Device: **Safari > Developer > Device Name > JSContext**    #### Breakpoints early in app lifecycle not getting hit?    Sometimes you cannot connect the debugger to the app until it's already executed the code you'd like to break at. One way to workaround this is to launch the simulator first, then open **Safari > Develop > Simulator** and ensure **Automatically Show Web Inspector for JSContexts** and **Automatically Pause Connecting to JSContexts** are both turned on/checked. Then launch the app/build via Studio/CLI and you should be able to connect and control the debugger before the app fully launches.      ## Using Google Chrome and ios-webkit-debug-proxy  Be sure to turn on use-jscore-framework as shown above first.    Google has created a proxy middleman utility to be able to use Google's Chrome tooling with iOS simulators/webkit, and it is available at [ios-webkit-debug-proxy](https://github.com/google/ios-webkit-debug-proxy)    From my own experience, I haven't been able to reliably use this to hit breakpoints and inspect the state of the app. However, I have found the Console tab to work for evaluating arbitrary code in the context of the app.    If you'd like to try it out:  - Launch the Simulator  - Launch the app  - Open Terminal and start ios-webkit-debug-proxy  - Open Google Chrome to http://localhost:9221/  - Click on the [link for the simulator](http://localhost:9222/)  - Click on the [? link](http://localhost:9222/devtools/devtools.html?ws=localhost:9222/devtools/page/1) for the inspectable page"

"TIDOC-2941","Bug","APIDoc",2,"Docs wrongly state Titanium supports targeting Android 7.x","This is in regards to the following ""Titanium Compatibility"" documentation...  http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix-section-src-29004837_safe-id-VGl0YW5pdW1Db21wYXRpYmlsaXR5TWF0cml4LUFuZHJvaWRTREsvVGFyZ2V0QW5kcm9pZFBsYXRmb3Jt    The documentation states that Titanium 6.0 and 5.1 supports a ""Max Target Android/SDK Version"" of 7.1 (API 25).  This is *not* true.  The max ""target"" is 6.0 (API 23), matching our min target.    Please change the max ""target"" to ""6.0.x (API 23)"" for top 2 rows:  - 6.0.0 - latest  - 5.1.0 - 5.5.x    Note that this means that the min Android target and max Android target will match after this change.    *Side Note:*  We plan on adding support to target Android 7.x in Titanium 6.2. This means we'll need to add a new row to this version table in the future."
