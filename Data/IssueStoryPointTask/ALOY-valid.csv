Original description    Just tested that, using alloy v1.8.2 and v1.8.5 I was unable to set the `attributedString` property via a `ListItem` template.  Using alloy 1.7.35 everything is working fine.    I attach a simple test project that contains a `ListView` with a template composed by two labels.  On the first label I set the `text` property with a simple model string and on the second one i set the `attributedString`.    For the first label everything is working correctly (as expected) and for the second one is working only using v1.7.35 of alloy."""

This ticket is about supporting apps where underscore is replaced by the developer.   I still think that ALOY-1168 should be implemented and I have developed it in a fork (https://github.com/mobilehero/adamantium/tree/feature/underscore-to-lodash), but I am having issues w/ the tests.    Currently, Alloy allows developer to replace the current version of underscore with a different version (or with lodash) by putting the updated underscore.js file in the directory: /app/lib/alloy.    However, the issue is that the code that Alloy generates for a controller that uses databinding, references the old version of _.template.       There are probably several different ways this could be solved to support both old and new versions of Underscore.   One might be to check the version of underscore.  I think the function was changed in 1.7.0.    Let me know if you think there is a workable solution and I can create a PR and tests for it.  Thanks!!    """
