Currently, however, only one version of each SDK can exist for TiStudio at one time using the ""Install Titanium SDK from URL"" feature. The workaround is to download and extract the packages to the SDK directory manually.  The suggestion is to append the date to the end of the SDK version number (most likely by simply naming the SDK directory to reflect this format). Thus, the package:  http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile/1_6_X/mobilesdk-1.6.3-20110418162355-linux.zip  would be shown in the TiApp editor as:  1.6.3-20110418  To add weight to the argument for this feature, Marshall has also agreed that it would be extremely useful."

For example, a project created for an Android deployment had the iOS targets grayed out.    It is possible to manually edit TiApp.xml to set targets to true. This enables the ""run on simulator"" for iOS, and in my test was able to launch the project in the simulator.

Expected:  Either no ability to add or remove targets after project creation or the ability to add with the same default structure as during project creation.    Suggested solution:    * user checks platform option in tiapp.xml  * Call platform script to initialize new platform.

This is problematic in some circumstances including when a developer installs a development Titanium SDK. Studio will automatically defer to this new version for verification of the correct configuration of the Android SDK. If there is an issue with the script or some other problem with the folder structure of the development Titanium SDK, it will disable the ability of Studio to use Android projects. Since it is not possible for QE to verify every development release has the correct structure and that the and.py script is present and functional, this is a potential risk area.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Configure studio to have 1.8.0.1 GA as the latest SDK  2) Install an SDK from master branch (1.9.0)  3) navigate to the folder for the 1.9.0 SDK and remove SDK FOLDER/android/avd.py  4) In studio, select the titanium preference pane or click ""configure..."" from the TIapp.xml overview    Result:  Android preference states ""Could not locate the Android SDK at the given path""    Expected:  Android SDK configuration verification based on method that is independent of Titanium SDK"

"TISTUD-1316","Bug","Tiapp",5,"Titanium Studio: TiApp Editor: Build Properties: Titanium SDK: if current sdk removed from filesystem, tiapp not updated","When an SDK folder (i.e., Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/2.0.0.v20120312104735) is removed from the filesystem (moved or deleted), the TiApp Editor SDK field for any open projects is set to nothing, and the tiapp.xml remains as the deleted SDK version.     It is expected that the SDK field in the TiApp Editor would immediately be updated to the latest SDK, as well as the tiapp.xml.    This expectation is reinforced by the fact that when the tiapp.xml file is re-opened in Studio, the TiApp Editor SDK field is set to the latest existing version of the SDK, and the tiapp.xml is updated to the latest SDK.    Note: As a related consequence (linked issue), when another SDK is selected in the TiApp Editor SDK field (when the field was previously blank), the respective tiapp.xml is not updated, resulting in an invalid configuration.    Note: As an edge case (linked issue), if all SDKs are removed from the SDK folder, they remain in the TiApp Editor SDK list, but they are later correctly removed when the tiapp.xml file is reloaded. The tiapp.xml SDK version remains as the last available version (expected).    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Create a new project.  2. Move the selected SDK version folder from it's directory to another location.    Expected Result:    The TiApp Editor SDK should immediately update to the highest available SDK version, and the tiapp.xml should be updated. This would occur anyway if the tiapp.xml file were re-opened in Studio.    Actual Result:    The TiApp Editor SDK field is blank, the tiapp.xml SDK version remains as the one removed."

We investigated, and noted that manipulating the pop-up for the SDK version would warn that the file had changed on the file system,and did she want to sync. With Shalom running us through some tests we determined a few things, most disconcerting is the fact that the Tiapp XML view had a different SDK listed than showed in the Overview. This explained the issue with building with the wrong SDK.    We still are investigating why the TiApp.xml is showing as out of sync from the file system perspective.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Install and run Studio  2) Create a project and build for device  3) Open TiApp.xml editor and change SDK then save  4) Continue to change SDK and save until you get warned about file system sync    Result:  After a few moments you should see the sync warning. You may also notice if you examine the XML that the SDK setting is not matching.    Expected:  No sync warnings simply manipulating the tiapp. No SDK setting mismatch."

Proposed Solution(s)    It would be good if you could specify by default whether you want to use the x86 or standard emulator for all projects, perhaps in {{Preferences -> Titanium Studio -> Titanium}}. It should be the standard emulator by default as the x86 emulator currently does not include the Google APIs (which would prevent the KitchenSink from running) and it does not support V8, as detailed in the linked ticket.    Also, it should be configurable on a per-project basis as well, for the same reasons I listed in the above paragraph.    So:    # We need to upgrade our AVI detection to show the available ABIs per device  # For devices with multiple ABIs we need to allow the user to select which one to use as part of the launch configuration, and that is passed as the first argument to the SDK for SDKs 2.1+. For < 2.1, we only pass the device argument  # We could add a preference in Titanium Preferences to default to x86 or standard emulator (were available). This would se the default ABI selection in the launch configuration.  "

For the third step, how can we prompt the user which platforms they wish to develop for, and help them through the configuration?

Studio should check for the JAVA_HOME before beginning a build, check if it is correctly set, and if it is missing or incorrect pass in a correct version into the build.    This issue is a not a regression since the bug is due to a user mis-configuration of JAVA_HOME.    Steps used to reproduce:  1. Ensure that the $JAVA_HOME global variable is set ( ls -R $JAVA_HOME ).  2. Create a new Titanium Mobile Project.  3. Create a signing key.  4. Package for Distribution (Package > Distribute - Android App Store)    Expected result:  Android correctly packages and a package file is created in the specified place.    Actual result:   The packager gets to titanium_prep.linux64 where it can not find java as $JAVA_HOME isn't available to it.    Tested by multiple sources on Titanium Studio build 2.1.1, 2.1.0, and 2.0.2 on both Ubuntu 12.04 and 10.04, using SDK 2.1.0GA replicated the same failure. Switching back to SDK 2.0.2GA fixes the issue in all studio platforms, as 2.1.0 is the first version to use JAVA_HOME in the packaging scripts.    Suggested solution:  * See if JAVA_HOME is set in such a way that the scripts can read it  * If it is, check if the JAVA_HOME variable is correct by checking for /lib/tools.jar at that path  * If it is incorrectly set, or not set, infer the JAVA_HOME location by using values from Studio's environment."

"TISTUD-2145","Improvement","Content Assist",0,"Highlight and warn about usage of deprecated API","Currently, although there is a ""deprecated"" flag defined in the JSCA format, it is not displayed in Studio.    For example, Ti.Network.INADDR_ANY is deprecated:    http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.1/index.html#!/api/Titanium.Network-property-INADDR_ANY    But if you attempt to use it in code:    var foo = Ti.Network.INADDR_ANY;    Studio will prompt you with a description and not show it as deprecated, or issue any kind of warning.    We can now include a deprecation message along with the version number in the YML docs, and it would be good if we could convey that through JSCA. We actually have three keys in the YAML:    Obviously, we shouldn't prompt for APIs that have been removed. We could omit these from the JSCA, or add a new annotation to the JSCA so you can post an appropriate message.    Ingo said we'd need to rev the JSCA version number to change deprecated from a boolean to dict to accomplish this.    When a new version is available, we can update the JSCA generator.    * Create version 1.1 of the JSCA format that supports an expanded deprecated flag. It may be that we can also creatively update the existing fields, i.e. place the deprecation notes in the main description, and just add a ""removed"" field, like the ""since"" we already have.  * If an item is deprecated in the JSCA, we should display an appropriate warning in content assist. It may also be that we have a flag _not_ to show deprecated items by default  * Deprecated items should prompt a warning in both the editor gutter and the problems view, ideally with a note indicating what the replacement is. This implies some sort of reconcile and build participant.  "

So for the base Studio, http://preview.appcelerator.com/appcelerator/studio/standalone/update/stable/ with be disabled and http://preview.appcelerator.com/appcelerator/studio/standalone/update/rc/ will be added and enabled.    This will apply to the add-on plugins that we provide as well, and we will keep the update url naming convention consistent across all the features. It will help reduce the likelihood of having incompatible versions of plugins installed against each other.    We could also have a remote file that contains the list of our update url prefixes, and we will append the right update stream type for the full URL to add and remove. This avoids the issue of user modifying the list of update sites manually and we no longer able to find the original url to replace.  "

"TISTUD-4917","Bug","Code Processor",8,"Code Analyzer: Alloy: When a Warning or Error is found for an Alloy project, code gutter icons are added to the Resources project files, not to App folder","h5. Problem description  When a Warning or Error is found by the Code Analyzer for an Alloy project, Warning or Error icons are placed in the code gutter in the Resources file projects instead than in the App file projects. The result is that the Project is now marked with the red/white error icon and the 'Errors in Workspace' alert is displayed every time the project is being build.     'Resources' folder is by default not visible for Alloy projects on Studio, so the default result is also that the project is marked with an error icon, but the user can't see any other red error icon next to any visible Project file.    Also, having an error or a warning reported for the Alloy compiled code in the Resources folder is not adding much value for the user as the intended behavior is not to manually modify the compiled code files in the Resources (user should only handle Alloy files, all included into the App folder).    h5. Steps to reproduce    Paste the sample code. Note the code error in the controller.js , where foobar is actually not a function.  The error is correctly reported by the Code Analyzer (see the screenshot), also getting the correct position in the Alloy project.  However, in Studio the Error icon is placed in 'Resources/alloy/controllers/index.js' , which is hidden by default and should in any case manually modified by the user.    h6. controller/index.js      h6. index.xml        h5.

The new flow:  # When we go to the link to download the NDK, there is no way we can download just the discreet NDK. We instead download the Momentics IDE  # The Momentics installs the NDK in new locations with different paths than before. Referencing the path inside Studio prompts the user with an error about missing directories with prefix '[install]'      h3. Related    They also have changed the flow to get the signing keys.

Instead of asking user each time to run a series of commands on their machine to figure out the underlying problem, we can add those commands in the diagnostic tests and that should let us give a fair idea on what is going on user's machine with just the diagnostic test logs.    When the NPM updates are invoked, either during startup or by the user -    1) It verifies whether the package is installed on the machine using 'npm -g ls <package>' command.  1.1) If the above command fails for any reason, then invokes 'npm -p ls -g'  2) If the package is available on the machine, it figures out the installed version and latest available version using 'npm view <package> version' command.    Also, since PREFIX is one of those dark areas, we need to add the prefix configuration to the diagnostic logs.    1) Environment variable : Get the system property for NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX  2) Get the prefix key from the npm configuration : npm config get prefix  3) If only the environment variable is set, then the local prefix config value differs from the global one. That can lead to discrepancies in the installation of npm packages. So we should get the output for : 'sudo npm config get prefix'. However, since we don't hold user's password, this might not be a feasible value to store in the diagnostic tests."

This pathing issue is both a Mac issue (where they edit their .bash profile and install paths e.g. VMware put node in /opt instead of the default location and then the installer went into loop checking for node updates and installing) and Windows issue (where IT redirects installs from the user directory to some other path that they standardize on an NFS share for all end users)  {quote}    I think we need more details here.

If a given component is required, we should not allow the user to dismiss the install - thus helping to avoid invalid setups because user's didn't accept. Obviously, this will still force sudo prompts on Mac/Linux for some of the installs right now (since npm packages are installed globally, and I think we need sudo rights for installing Node?).    From Aditya:  {quote}  I can't count the number of times over the past several weeks where we have worked with every developer, tester, partner etc. and they only complete half the setup because they don't read the docs.

There are wiki pages devoted to how you can alter p2 behavior at http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Adding_Self-Update_to_an_RCP_Application#Reassembling_the_UI    The basic gist of it is that we may want to copy and fork the p2.ui.sdk.scheduler plugin rather than just include it. That includes the standard automatic updates check and popup. We can then make our version do both checks and present our own UI.    Another alternative is to write p2 repository related code to allow loading the SDK metadata/artifacts and NPM package metadata/artifacts and converting them into the p2 model. That would make the same check for update job check all of them, but we'd still need our own custom UI override (though we may then be able to add metadata to the CLI package.json to do dependency checking against Studio?)."
