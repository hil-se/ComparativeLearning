"MDL-31410","Bug","Enrolments",3,"PayPal IPN Script exposed to message_send() failure","""The below issue includes the resolution. It merely needs to be marked as fixed and merged in to the main development branch.    The ipn.php script, that is a part of the Paypal enrolment method, makes calls to a function """"message_send"""" that can cause the entire PayPal enrolment method to fail.    The ipn script is called by PayPal when a payment has been processed. Paypal calls the script and passes various tokens regarding the transaction. The ipn script:    1) Opens a handle for the paypal connection  2) Evaluates the received tokens and validates them  3) Enrols a student accordingly  4) Notifies the student, instructors & admins via a call to """"message_send()""""  5) Closes the connection from paypal    Various people have been reporting that their paypal enrolments work fine for a while, but they start getting these IPN failure warning messages from Paypal. In their IPN history in Paypal, they see a list of failed transactions where the server (moodle) response was a 404.    What's happening for these people, is the 4th step above is failing. The ipn script dies as a product of message_send() failing and the PHP server process would seem to time out and cause the web server to return a 404 to paypal. Since step 3 has been completed, end users of moodle are getting what they need from the plugin. However Paypal doesn't tolerate the 404 responses for long and automatically disables IPN messaging after a while - causing paypal enrolments to fail entirely.    The solution I'm proposing is really simple. I've modified ipn.php to use a wrapper function for message_send that puts the call in try-catch block. This insulates the execution of ipn.php from whatever message_send failures ruining the whole experience. I believe resolving the issue in message_send is another matter (and may merely be a misconfiguration thing - though myself and others do have systems that send us emails successfully, guess those situations aren't depending on the same function).    I've attached my modified version of ipn.php below. I hope it is immediately merged in to the main development branch as this is probably affecting even more people than have been complaining about it.    This issue has been observed by me personally across a wide range of 2.x Moodle installations. I've avoided fixing it myself and have just run on weekly builds hoping someone else would fix it.

I think both these use-cases are important, and so need to be implemented in the API, but from what I can see, this will be hard because:  * messages can hang around for some time in the message_working table - that is, there is no guarantee that messages are sent synchronously - it is up to the message output plugins.  * The from address in the message table is stored as a userid in a NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 column.

"MDL-31776","Improvement","Language|Usability",100,"Additional name fields, to allow Asian languages to flexibly display user names in Chinese characters, local phonetic system or Romanization","""h3. Alternate name fields  *This is a proposal on behalf of The Moodle Association of Japan (http://moodlejapan.org). We are willing to work closely with Moodle HQ on this improvement and help by providing some funding for its development.*  The standard Moodle has only two fields for names """"firstname"""" and """"lastname"""". In countries that use a different writing system, this means that two sets of names need to be displayed, their name in the local writing system and their name in Romanization. Moodle needs a way to input both types of names, and for both the individual and the administrator (and perhaps at the course level) to determine which names appear in the various Moodle contexts.   *An ideal configuration*  I propose three additional fields: *surnamephon givenphon alternatename*   For standard English and European usage, these would be ignored, but for Japanese, Chinese, Korean and perhaps other writing systems such as Thai, the various Indian languages and Arabic. Possible entries would look like this:    || ||lastname||firstname||lastphon||firstphon||Alternate|| |Japanese|佐藤|宏|サトウ|ヒロシ|Satou Hiroshi| |Korean|李 |奎報| 이|규보|Yi Gyubo| |Chinese|陳|美和|ㄔㄣ|ㄇㄟㄏㄨㄚ|Chen MeiHua|   The site administrator would select how the $FULLNAME variable would appear. For Japanese, for example, the administrator might select lastname + firstname + alternate so that the students' names would appear in Kanji, but with the Romanization of it following the Kanji.  This would allow everyone to know how the name should be pronounced.  (Even Japanese need this since there are alternate pronunciations for Kanji. """"神部"""" for example, could be read as """"Kamibe"""" or """"Kambe"""" depending on the preference of the user's family.)   Any combination of the above could also be selected as the default for user names that appear in various tables.  If the selected fields for tables is one of the Asian phonetic fields, then rather than the standard alphabet display for filtering the list by first name and last name, a similar selection display would appear for the selected alphabetic system.  For Chinese, a selection would also need to be made for the phonetic system to use.  Taiwan uses the """"BoPoMoFo"""" (Zhuyin) system, while mainland China uses the Pinyin system.  *Student ID Display*  For many Asian languages, another problem not encountered so much in the West is people with identical names. This, plus the fact that some of the languages (namely Japanese and Chinese) have no convenient method for ordering names in Chinese characters, means that most schools rely on the student ID for ordering and identifying students rather than (or in addition to) their names.  Thus, there should also be an option in the site set-up selecting the StudentID field to be displayed to the left of names on various listings such as the grade book, assignment evaluation, etc.  *Complexity & coding time:*  This problem is quite complex since it involves modifying core code in perhaps 50-100 files that do database I/O, table displays, preference selections, etc. and would need to be done in close coordination with Moodle Headquarters.  *Who would benefit from this improvement?:* Probably every institution in Asia that has staff who do not read the local language need to be able to display names in both the local language and Roman letters. Various, rather unsatisfactory ad hoc solutions are currently used but a permanent, more elegant solution is urgently needed. """

So adding the timeout here gets the backup process to fail after the timeout (rather than waiting for a fastcgi timeout). It looks like mssql just not responding.    I wanted to see what was happening with the tables, which is hard for mssql and temp tables, since they're session based. I don't have access to the moodle db sessions' temp tables from my db admin tool.    To get around this, I modified \backup\util\dbops\backup_controller_dbops_class.php (around line 141&150), so that a real table was created/deleted, instead of using MSSQLs session based temp tables (just removed """"_temp_"""" in the calls to dbman, ie   $dbman->create_temp_table($xmldb_table); becomes  $dbman->create_table($xmldb_table);   and around 150   $dbman->drop_temp_table($table); becomes  $dbman->drop_table($table);    There's a similar fix neccessary in   \backup\util\dbops\restore_controller_dbops_class.php, line 109,     With this change, the backup and restore work ok.     My hypothesis is that at some point during the long backup, another connection gets made to mssql; since temp tables are associated with connections, the link to the original temp table gets lost and the data isn't available. Of course this doesn't explain why the sqlsrv call ust times out rather than returning an error.    We've actually been using the system with this little change, but it's not really satisfactory -- the problem, of course, is that only one backup/restore can be run on the system at any one time because there's just the one temp table; and multiple backups just conflict, requiring the temp table we created to be dropped.

I've coded something in the branch https://github.com/brki/moodle/tree/mdl23-preload-filters-for-course-categories . The commit https://github.com/brki/moodle/commit/da23cce06d7edbd2cad43ba9c25396dcf5bfac35 preloads all the course category context instances for course/index.php and course/category.php.  This reduces the database queries significantly (it makes two database queries to get all of the course category contexts instead of one for every course category). """

If blocks without headings are removed, JS code starts working again so presumably presence of those blocks causes the error.    -----  Original description:    Thread here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=228086#p997260    Upgraded to 2.5 from 2.3 this week, initially used an incomplete zip file.  Subsequently corrected.  Since then the Activity Chooser behaves inconsistently in courses.      Case 1  In some courses it is greyed out.  Switching it off allows the drop-down lists to work - but only if you quickly select an option, otherwise it fails - jumpto.php appears to get an empty string in this case and also drag and drop of course items does not work.    Case 2  In some other courses, using the Activity Chooser to select an activity or resource generates an error on selection of the activity or resource.  Switching off the Activity chooser allows selection properly through the drop-down lists.  In these course drag and drop of items works as expected.    We are using Moodle 2.5+ (Build: 20130524) on SQL SERVER 2008 MS SQL 10.5.250 PHP 5.3.18 FreeTDS drivers.    Upgrade error was reported in MDL-39869 (closed). """

In Moodle we don't have AJAX login, and we have mitigated against the https -> http issue by always setting the wwwroot to the current schema.    However, it would be really super nice if we *could* have AJAX login, and I don't feel that the reasons which once prevented forced use of HTTPS throughout a site are as strong as they used to be. Hardware performance is far better than it was five years ago; it's been [proven how easy it is to steal sessions from non-ssl|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep] so these things are no longer theoretical or even hard; and SSL is far more widespread.    As it is, we already load all additional content (e.g. CSS, JS, image) over SSL so it's now just the actual page content which is not.    We no longer have issues with third-party plugins not supporting SSL (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc).    I'd like to propose that we drop support for loginhttps.

It should be on the link tag. (Additionally, there is an unnecessary title attribute on the img tag.)    This was caused by MDL-37085.    The previous code was:        This code is correct, with a title attribute on the A tag containing the full text, and an alt attribute (no title) on the IMG tag.    For accessibility reasons, none of these titles are suitable anyway. All links should have different texts so while the longer text includes the name of the item being moved, that doesn't actually help as it's still the same for all of them. An accessible solution would use text like:    'Move item to Week 4 before """"Study resources""""'    In other words, I didn't describe the item being moved (because they probably know, and it's the same for all of them) but I included the section name of the target location and a relative before/after for the position within that section.    I am not sure whether or not it is worth doing anything about this because I know Moodle HQ is planning to stop supporting the non-JS graceful degradation features. I was thinking about fixing the regression and putting it back to have the right attribute on the right tag, but since it's inaccessible even after doing that (and always was), I don't think I am going to bother...    So probably just filing this bug and leave it for Moodle staff to decide what to do, sorry!

So - some fonts were stripped etc to keep the size of that one down - and it was still over 30MB. An alternative is to use the CDN mathjax library by default - and provide a method to download and install the full version into moodledata for people who require it (firewall/proxy etc).    2/ It does things properly (moodley) by wrapping the mathjax library a yui module and including it from the footer. This means that the loading of mathjax does not block the rest of the page displaying. The downside is that the alternative method of installing mathjax is to link to it in additionalhtmlhead. This includes mathjax earlier, so the equations on the page are rendered earlier - and some people prefer that option. Maybe there is an alternative way of including it that will load it earlier.    3/ However it is loaded/linked etc. In the forum samples I have seen, it is linked to from the head with almost a default configuration.

I am reasonably sure that it is not exploitable, but I am not a security expert therefore I thought I'd better report it just in case. Feel free to close as not a bug if that is the case.    The report is as follows:    It has been detected by exploiting the parameter imagefile of the form located in URL [SITEURL]/user/edit.php?id=70&course=1    Request:    POST [SITEURL]/user/edit.php    Payload:        Response:        There is a similar issue with the summary_editor[itemid] parameter of editor form elements.    The problem only occurs in forms where the submitted value is being set as the initial value for the field when the form fails validation and is being redisplayed. Someone could potentially insert something malicious in the value field and have it executed when the page returns.    The reason we don't think this is exploitable is that it seems that the malicious code can only originate and execute on the same client.    However we did note that the Chrome XSS-Auditor blocked the code from executing """"because [the script's] source code was found within the request"""".    We had a look to see where the problem is. It appears to be with the way the values for these form elements are filtered when server side validation of the form has failed. """"getCleanType"""" is returning """"cleanhtml"""" and """"raw"""" for the editor and filemanager elements, respectively. """"clean_param"""" with type PARAM_CLEANHTML is being applied to all three of the parameters for the editor, """"description_editor[text]"""", """"description_editor[format]"""" and """"description_editor[itemid]"""", while the """"itemid"""" and """"format"""" parameters seem to only even contain integers. """"imagefile"""" is being cleaned with type PARAM_RAW (the default when no setType has been specified).

"MDL-44002","Task","Accessibility|Policy",40,"Decide upon intended screen reader support","""Each of the Screen Readers we've come across seem to do things their way, and have differing levels of support for:  * different accessibility features;  * browsers; and  * operating systems    We need to determine which screen reader(s) we intend to make Moodle work best with in order to choose the most optimal solution for these readers.    Our selection also has a big impact upon the amount of time it requires to develop new functionality and changes, and to test it.    From the compatibility matrix I've created so far (http://goo.gl/b4cVb5), there are approximately 30 combinations of screen reader + browser + operating system available to users.    h4. Considerations    Ideally, this should be as few combinations as possible because as we add each combination, the complexity increases dramatically, as does the time required for development and testing.    The ideal solution would be for a single, well documented, well tested, and widely available screenreader, but as http://goo.gl/b4cVb5 shows, this will not be possible as no screen reader supports both Windows, Macintosh, and Linux whilst providing support for multiple browsers.    Whilst Mobile support would be desirable, I think initially we should focus on improving the support for desktop screen readers as a priority and look at adding mobile combinations later.    h4. Options    Data suggests that the most widely used _primary_ Reader by far is *Jaws* [1] though it's usage has seen rapid decline over the past few years.    Jaws is followed in popularity by Windows-Eyes, and Apple's Voiceover.    ChromeVox is the only screen reader we've come across to support the same browser across multiple operating systems which may also be an important consideration for some users. At present its market share is low (0.2% [1]) but it is new to the arena - from what I can tell it was only released in February 2012 [2] with the survey taking place in May 2012.    NVDA, which came in at fourth place in the webaim survey is also an interesting option as it is the highest ranked free solution for Windows, though it is only compatible with Windows and the Firefox + IE browsers.    h4. Recommendations    To offer the most widespread selection it makes sense to choose from the following subset of screen readers.    I have not, at this stage, commented on the ease of development for each screen reader at present, or it's comparative support for various accessiblity functionality.    h5. Jaws  Pros:  * High market penetration    Cons:  * Cost to users  * Windows only  * Internet Explorer only    h5. NVDA  Pros:  * Free  * Mid-level market penetration    Cons:  * Windows only  * Firefox and Internet Explorer only    h5. OS X VoiceOver  Pros:  * Free  * Supports all browsers tested  * Also available on iOS    Cons:  * Mac OS Only    h5. ChromeVox  Pros:  * Free  * Cross-Operating system    Cons:  * Google Chrome only      h4.

Possible solutions    h3.

B/ new $PAGE->get_request_origin()    The idea is to have one method that tells you if you are doing something from normal page, ws, cli, restore. The restore code would use some private API to tell PAGE that restore starts/end or it could even use 1/, but that would require a new observer which does not seem optimal to me. At the same time we could add $PAGE->get_request_ip().    After A/ or B/ is implemented we could filter out logs coming from the restore process in stats and other areas where we want to ignore the events triggered during restore.    The next step would be to optionally restore the original log data - we would need backup/restore support in log stores and new method in base event class which would have to be overridden by events that can recalculate the ids.

The general approach here is to refactor the existing navbar's capabilities, allowing it to support multiple dropdowns without adversely affecting existing DOM structure (which would necessitate every theme re-targeting its styles).    Update 10/06/2014: The user menu is being rendered fine, but the current solution doesn't quite encapsulate everything that'll need to happen with the navbar; in particular, page_heading_menu() stuff isn't handled by this solution as it doesn't really make sense for that stuff to live in a dropdown.    Update 24/06/2014: Okay, this turned out to be huge.    - The new {{user_menu}} renderable is an extension of the {{custom_menu}} renderable, constructed with references to a user, a course, a page and an array of flags (at present, the only thing that makes sense to set _a priori_ is {{guest}}, a boolean flag).  -- Basing the new renderable on the {{custom_menu}} allows for it to be easily displayed in Base-based themes as well.  -- A minor bug in {{custom_menu}}'s YUI3 dropdown code was fixed: in brief, the logic was looking for a dropdown attribute on the node that was clicked (e.target) instead of the node that the event was actually wired to (e.currentTarget).  - {{custom_menu}} renderables have been extended by way of MDL-46022 and have also gained the ability to assign CSS suffix flags to {{custom_menu_item}}s - which is necessary for us to avoid having to hardcode icons into the renderer PHP.  - In order to support multiple collapsible menus, it was necessary to create an entire {{bootstrap_navbar}} renderable which renders the {{body > header}} element and renders out a collection of menus.

We want to have components containing existing elements and components, and when we want to change how an element looks we want that change reflected in all uses of the element within other components that don't require it to look different.  This way you can style a button and instantly have the look updated across other components like search forms containing buttons.    *Elements and components can be complex*  Elements don't need to be easy to write - they should be feature full and limited in number. Developers should not write components instead they should be re-using the available elements and components.    *Overriding a render to change how an element must be both easy and robust*  Re-use is key as per the above point.  However we need to achieve this in such a way that we don't introduce magic and keep things simple to understand and override.

"MDL-45935","Bug","Automated functional tests (behat)|Backup",5,"Slow behat tests for backup","""When we run behat backup tests, we pass a table such as:        We then call i_backup_course_using_this_options, passing in those options. That in turn handles the backup process looking at each page.    At each page, it uses the following to fill in the form:      Which then looks for each option in the table and fills it in. Since most of those settings are only found on one page, we then wait 12 seconds for the search for that option to fail to be found (which we ignore with a try/catch).    https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/backup/util/ui/tests/behat/behat_backup.php#L351    The result is that each test involving backups takes a good minute just to fill in the each page of the backup form, for three pages making about 3 minutes of wasted time in timeouts. By fixing this, we should be able to knock a good few minutes off behat runtimes."""

For instance the first 8 characters of the username 'ted' are 'dGVk'.     I am certainly no security expert but if a site for whatever reason decided to stop using Shibboleth anyone could stick a bunch of known usernames through Base64 and easily have the first 8 characters.
