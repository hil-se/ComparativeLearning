We should check that the requested exposure time is in this range, before we ever attempt to configure the measurement, and raise an exception early if it is not.

This makes it more difficult to implement library mocks as I have done for the fiber spectrograph: the mock cannot patch over an already loaded library.

To avoid making this decision in different connectors and potentially in different deployments of the EFD, the definition of which timestamp to use in the EFD should be done in the SAL Kafka Producer instead.     There are different ways to accomplish this.    The easiest one is to create a new field in the Avro schema called, for example, {{private_efdStamp}} which is a copy of whatever timestamp field we should use. Initially, that can be hardcoded to use {{private_sndStamp}}.    The other way is making use of """"aliases"""" in Avro:    https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.1/spec.html#Aliases    that create an alternate name {{private_efdStamp}} for the timestamp field we want to use.     NOTE: we assume aliases work the way we expect but that needs to be tested. In the above KSQL query {{SELECT * FROM mytopic}} ensures that all fields in {{mytopic}} will be inserted as fields in InfluxDB with their original names and  {{WITHTIMESTAMP private_efdStamp}} will use the alternate name to use the right timestamp as the InfluxDB timestamp.    Either way, the different connectors always use {{private_efdStamp}}.    Another benefit of doing this in the SAL Kafka producer code or in the Avro schema is that changes to the code or to the Avro schema are versioned, while changes in the connector configuration are not.     This ticket is not blocking anything in the moment. But having the {{private_efdStamp}} would make the EFD configuration more realiable."""

However, such tests do not verify:   * whether a task's {{Connections}} are correctly written and whether they match the inputs and outputs of the {{run}} method   * any logic in a custom {{runQuantum}} method   * configuration logic, such as optional or alternative inputs or outputs    Since the Gen 3 API is unfamiliar to us, these aspects of a {{PipelineTask}} are the ones that are most likely to have bugs.    Currently, the only way to test these features is in large-scale runs on Gen 3 repositories (e.g., HSC). Such tests, while valuable, can only exercise a small subset of conditions (e.g., configs), can be expensive to debug (e.g., due to cascading failures), and do not protect against regressions (no CI). A {{pytest}}-compatible framework that lets us test those parts of a {{PipelineTask}} that lie _outside_ {{run}} will let us catch problems much faster.    As part of DM-21875, I created a prototype [test framework for direct Butler I/O|https://github.com/lsst/verify/blob/b3f960befa179cee8050cdf380fd16c8a2acbafd/tests/butler_utils.py] and used it to verify that datasets could be stored to and retrieved from a dummy, obs-agnostic repository. I believe the same approach can be used to test {{PipelineTask}} functionality without the need to simulate a """"realistic"""" Butler or depend on {{obs}} packages.    Desired features:   * a natural way for the test author to provide mock data IDs for the repository. The appropriate IDs will depend on the task being tested. It should be possible to simplify this from the prototype code, since most of the complexity of the Gen 3 Dimensions system is not needed for most tests; an exception may be {{ImageDifferenceTask}}'s mix of detector-level and patch-level inputs.   * a simple activator that calls {{runQuantum}} without modifications other than mocking {{run}}   * a way to test that the desired inputs get passed to {{run}}, including self-consistent use of config flags -and templates-. This will probably involve mocking {{run}} and may involve mock datasets, which are more technically challenging.   * a way to verify the output of a (real) {{run}} call against a configured connections object   * -analogous support for {{\_\_init\_\_}} inputs and outputs, which I'm less familiar with-"""

However, it suffices to set the value when the Domain Participant is created. So I propose the following:  * When the ScriptQueue starts up it reads the OpenSplice configuration file pointed to by OSPL_URI.  * If it finds """"masterPriority=<number>"""" then it writes a copy of the file to a temporary directory with masterPriority=0 and changes OSPL_URI to point to the copy.  * Thus we only have to maintain a single copy of the configuration file and any scripts that are launched will use masterPriority=0.

"DM-23607","Story","meas_extensions_scarlet",5,"Model deconvolution kernel using scarlet","""Before DFTs were integrated into scarlet, the earliest version of the code calculated the difference kernel needed to do partial convolutions from the narrow model PSF into the wider observed PSFs in each band using scarlet itself.     The basic algorithm is as follows:  * In scarlet we typically define a model PSF {{M}} that is a nyquist sampled gaussian with {{sigma=1/sqrt(2)}}. Fitting sources in the model to the observed images in each band requires convolving the PSF in each band ({{P_b}} with a difference kernel, the kernel needed to match the PSF in the model seeing to the PSF in the observed seeing. So the difference kernel {{D}} is given by {{P=M*D}}.  * The current version of scarlet uses the same technique as the one described in the galsim paper ([Rowe 2014|https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7676] to calculate the difference kernel in k-space, however the first version of scarlet made this calculation in real space.  * In real space we defined the observed image as the observed PSF and the """"difference kernel"""" used to convolve the model was the model PSF. This works because convolution commutes, so {{P=M*D=D*M}}. In other words, if we define our _model_ to be the difference kernel and convolve it with the model PSF, we can fit the result to the observed PSF and use the same algorithm used in scarlet to fit the model to find the best fit observed PSF without ever going into k-space.  * This worked quite well but was not as fast as matching the kernel in k-space, since the real space calculation required an iterative solution with the k-space version took only one pass. However, the problem with the k-space solution is that performing deconvolution, going from a wider PSF to a narrower PSF is ill-defined in k-space and leads to divergences in the difference kernel, making it numerically unstable.  * Earlier work in DM-20127 attempted to see if we could live with the numerical artifacts produced by the k-space deconvolution but the results were dependent on how different the model PSF and observed PSF were, with limitations on the upper-bound of the observed PSF before numerical artifacts dominated and the initialization was made worse.  * This ticket is to explore using the same real space PSF matching used in the previous version of scarlet, using the improved optimization algorithms of scarlet 1.0, to calculate the deconvolution kernel (the kernel to go from model PSF to observed PSF) to see if it can produce a more numerically stable result.

The *ConfigurableCsc*Â class in ts_salobj is the basic CSC (Commendable SAL Component) class for the subsystem such as *MtaosCsc*Â in ts_MTAOS to use. The configuration file is located at MTAOS directory of ts_config_mttcs. The following document explains the details of this:Â [TSTN-017|https://tstn-017.lsst.io/]. When writing the configuration file, a schema is needed to verify the configuration file based on:Â [Write a CSC|https://ts-salobj.lsst.io/salobj_cscs.html#writing-a-csc].    OFC is the component that calculates the correction of mirror bending mode and hexapod position. The control algorithm in use can follow [Real time wavefront control system for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RyMQWeXWRZLtxM8KkSwtB3STzMM9fCvX/view?usp=sharing] and [Control Algorithm in Optical Feedback Control|https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LTS/Control+Algorithm+in+Optical+Feedback+Control]. The state0 (*s*~*0*~ in the [Control Algorithm in Optical Feedback Control|https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LTS/Control+Algorithm+in+Optical+Feedback+Control]) is an intentional parameter used in *x00*Â reference, which is explained in the above links.    The AOS software contains the simulation code and control code. For the simulation, the user needs to use the repos: ts_wep, ts_ofc, and ts_phosim. For the control code, the user needs to use the repos: ts_wep, ts_ofc, and ts_MTAOS. The ts_phosim is not needed in the control and the ts_MTAOS is not needed in the simulation. In this task, we focus on the control code.    The followings are the steps in this task:   # Update the [default.yaml|https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_config_mttcs/blob/develop/MTAOS/v1/default.yaml] in ts_config_mttcs to contain the state0 information as the following: [state0inDof.yaml|https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_ofc/blob/master/policy/comcam/state0inDof.yaml]. I prefer to have two yaml files (default.yaml + state0inDof.yaml) instead of one (default.yaml) in ts_config_mttcs. However, we need to check ts_salobj can support this or not.   # Provide the related schema: [MTAOS.yaml|https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_MTAOS/blob/master/schema/MTAOS.yaml] in ts_MTAOS/schema directory. Prefer to have two files instead of one. But this depends on the implementation of ts_salobj.   # Update *MtaosCsc*Â class in ts_MTAOS to read the configuration of state0. *MtaosCsc.configure()*Â will read the configuration file from SAL. *ConfigByObj*Â and *ConfigByFile*Â classes inherit from *ConfigDefault*Â to read the data. We need to update the related test cases to make sure the *MtaosCsc*Â can change the state0 by SAL or file.   # Override the default state0 when *OFCCalculation*Â is instantiated by *OFCCalculationFactory.getCalculator()*Â in *Model.ofc*. The state0 is stored in the internal data of *Model.ofc.ztaac.optCtrl*. The developer can do *OFCCalculation.getZtaac()*Â to get the *ztaac*Â attribute. After this, the developer can use *ZTAAC.setState0()*Â to set the state0 values. The related *get()*Â functions are provided for the test. By default, the state0 is set by *OFCCalculation()*Â --> *OFCCalculation._configZTAAC()* --> *ZTAAC.setState0FromFile()*. It is noted that we will keep the default state0 file in ts_ofc for the simulation (the AOS simulation does not know the ts_MTAOS.

Depending on the amount of data ingested into that table during a transaction the index building operation may noticeably slow down the commit phase of the transaction. After gaining the first experience with using the new Ingest system it has become apparent that some workflows may benefit from having the _secondary index_ construction as an explicit stage deferred till a moment when all director table's contributions were loaded into Qserv.    Hence, a goal of the current development is to refine and extend the REST API of the Master Replication Controller to allow more options in building the index. Specifically, the following changes are proposed:  * add an optional parameter *build_secondary_index=<val>* to existing database creation service to indicate an intent to defer the index creation till the very last stage. The default value of the parameter will be 0 which would preserve the current behavior.  * extend the database information structure DatabaseInfo with the corresponding flag.  * modify the transaction commit service not to make contributions into the index if the deferred index construction for the database was requested.  * add a new POST service for constructing indexes as a separate operation to be performed before (or with extra controls) after publishing a database. The service should also allow an optional parameter to allow rebuilding the index from scratch.  * update the documentation on the Ingest System accordingly.  * evaluate if the version of the Ingest API needs to be incremented as well."""

"DM-26052","Improvement","ts_middleware",1,"Please document private fields and the ackcmd topic in the HTML for ts_xml","""Please add documentation for the private fields present for all topics in the HTML generated from ts_xml. Please also document the ackcmd topic. None of these are defined in the XML, so this documentation will have to be manually created and maintained.    The following descriptions are my own understanding and are how ts_salobj uses them (though users can set the public fields of the ackcmd topic as they like). Anyone should feel free to correct me if I am mistaken. I have added [~dmills], [~tribeiro], and [~rbovill] as watchers for this reason.    I suggest that the private fields be documented in one place (even though they are present for all topics) to avoid needless repetition. But do as you think best. The private fields, which are present on all topics are:    * private_sndStamp: time at which the sample was sent (TAI, unix seconds).  * private_rcvStamp: time at which the sample was received (TAI, unix seconds).  * private_identity: For a CSC this has the form <SAL component name>[:index] e.g. """"Script:5"""" or """"ATDome"""". For a user this has the form username@host. This field is used for authorization. New in ts_sal 4.2.  * private_origin: the process ID of the writer.  * private_host: the host address of the writer. This is deprecated, and due to be removed in ts_sal 5.  * private_seqNum: for commands this uniquely identifies the command (within a reasonable timespan, since the value must eventually wrap around). For other kinds of topics this may be incremented for each sample, though that is optional.  * <SAL component name>ID e.g. ScriptID (only present for indexed SAL components): the SAL index of the writer.    The ackcmd topic is how commands are acknowledged. Note that there is just one ackcmd topic that is used to acknowledge all commands. The public fields and one private field of the ackcmd topic are as follows:    * private_seqNum: the private_seqNum of the command being acknowledged.  * ack: the acknowledgement code, one of the CMD_ constants, such as CMD_COMPLETE = 303 or CMD_FAILED = -302.  * error: the error code. Set to a nonzero value if ack=CMD_FAILED.  * result: salobj sets this to an error message if ack=CMD_FAILED. I am not sure if it is used for anything else.  * identity: the private_identity of the command being acknowledged (see below).  * host: the private_host of the command being acknowledged. private_host is deprecated, so this field is also deprecated, and both should be gone in ts_sal 5.  * origin: the private_origin of the command being acknowledged, which is a process ID.  * cmdtype: command identifier: I believe this is supposed to be the 0-based index of the command in an alphabetical list of all topics for that SAL component. That is surprising to me as the list includes all topics, not just command topics. I hope I am wrong, but if so, I need to fix it in ts_salobj.  * timeout: the approximate expected duration of the command. Only set if ack=CMD_INPROGRESS.    I am not sure if you want to also explain the acknowledgement sequence here. It should certainly be documented somewhere, and this might be a nice place for it. As a quick reminder:    * The initial ack code is CMD_ACK when the command is read.  * If the command will take a long time to run then the CSC should respond with a CMD_INPROGRESS ack that includes an estimate of the command duration. This should only happen after the command has been approved.  * Usually the next ack is the final one for this command and is typically one of:  ** CMD_COMPLETE if the command finishes successfully.  ** CMD_FAILED if the command fails.  ** CMD_NOPERM if the command issuer is not authorized to send the command.  ** CMD_ABORTED if the command is superseded.  * CMD_TIMEOUT is returned if the command _issuer_ times out waiting for command completion. Note that it is the issuer, not the CSC, that returns this. If the command times out inside the CSC then the ack code is CMD_FAILED. In particular note that if the issuer gives up waiting for command completion and then the command finishes, the user will only see the CMD_TIMEOUT ack, but the DDS system will see the final ack from the CSC.  * There are at least two other CMD_ codes as well:  ** CMD_NOACK: ts_salobj sets the ackcmd field of AckTimeoutError to this value if no CMD_ACK was seen for the command before the command timed out. I am not sure how non-salobj systems use this code.  ** CMD_STALLED: I think the intent is to indicate """"this is going more slowly than I expected, but I am still working on it.""""
