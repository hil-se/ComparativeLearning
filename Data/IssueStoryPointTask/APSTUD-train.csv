"APSTUD-3723","Story","Content Assist|Editor|Navigation|PHP",1,"PHP: Open Method (ala PDT) functionality","PDT has an ""Open Method"" that allows the user to navigate to any method/class in any PHP file in a project/workspace.  This makes it a lot easier to locate a particular method or browse methods when looking the right method to use.  The list of methods is filterable (find as you type) and allows wildcards ({{*}}) as well to allow more flexible method listings.    Now that Aptana Studio 3 conflicts with PDT so that PDT's editor no longer works properly, it would be great if Aptana Studio added this feature to further round out the workflow that was lost from PDT.    For reference, the ""Open Method"" feature in PDT is launched via the following shortcut by default: {{CTRL+SHIFT+M}}"

"APSTUD-4281","Story","Editor|Indexing",40,"As a developer I want to be able to turn on and off specific validators for build vs reconcile","We need some way to turn off validators individually, and in particular between build vs reconcile. This stems from the poor performance of the JS validators during large builds. They should default to be on for reconcile (only the ones currently on by default) and off for build (likely the same for the CSS/HTML validators). We'll need a preference page similar to the validator pref page we had before (maybe just re-use/fix it to work).    One suggestion is to reuse the existing pref page and instead have a table at the top with two checkbox columns, one for build and one for reconcile. A less-optimal solution is to have two separate lists, one for each type of interaction.    Perhaps we should say ""On Typing"" as opposed to ""Reconcile""? Perhaps that is more user-friendly?    Tasks:  * Change the pref page  * Add some methods/fields to the participants to mark them as validators  * Use a more sane preference key scheme to store the enable/disable  * Create a migration function to migrate the old pref keys to the new scheme  * Some build participants need to be unchangeable or hidden from the end user (like indexing)  "

The connected filewatcher on the repo should pick up a file event or two to the ""index"" file which will trigger a batch refresh.  - When we do refresh we call one process and then we spawn off 3 parallel jobs to each run another process to update our listings.

"APSTUD-4406","Improvement","Editor|Validation",13,"Character Encoding options broken, falsely reporting UTF-8","A well known issue with deploying Titanium projects to android that has existed for a long, long time is problems with the Android emulator requiring files to be UTF-8.    So naturally if you ran across the issue when using TiStudio, you would right click the files, go to properties and check your 'Text file encoding' was set to UTF08. It automatically chooses the option titled 'Inherited from container (UTF-8)'.    So according to Aptana/TiStudio, the file is set to UTF-8. Yet the android emulator is still throwing a wobbly over a non UTF-8 file.    I then opened the exact file in Coda (by panic.com) to find that every single one of the Titanium Studio files was in face set to ""Western (Mac OS Roman)"" and not UTF-8. I edited the files to UTF-8 via Coda and hey presto, the android project works. The same action in Aptana/TiStudio does not work, it leaves the files in their old encoding.    The bug here is quite simply that the Aptana text file encoding options for files dont change the file encoding at all. This has been present since at very least when Appcelerator bought out Titanium Studio.

An example is the very common JS idiom for giving an argument a default value or type in the case that it is omitted when the function is called:    {code:JavaScript}  function foo (optionalString) {      optionalString = optionalString || """"; // if it's been left out, make sure it's a string.      /* do other stuff... */  }  {code}    Inference could deduce the type of a logical expression to be the union of the types of its operands, but in my experience, the actual desired type is always the type of the right operand if it isn't Boolean."

"APSTUD-4590","Improvement","Scripting",13,"Add support for union, intersection, and grouping operators to scope selectors","TextMate scope syntax supports '&', '|', and parenthesis to create more explicit scope selectors. Our current implementation supports ""descendant selector"", ',', and '-' (negative lookahead). In order to support these new operators, we will need to create a true parser. We should be able to use existing ISelectorNode (the AST nodes); however, there is a subtle difference between a descendant selector and the & operator. A descendant selector can match any segment from the current position within the scope to the end of the scope. The & operator is used for intersection, so it will need its own node type. Additionally, we will need a node for parenthesis to make it easier to reverse an AST back to source. We use the source for some types of equality testing.

This are showing up now because we're actually parsing scope selectors whereas before we were simply splitting strings. I do wonder why categories like ""-Common-"" are not showing. It may be that parse recovery is dropping the final dash."
"APSTUD-4641","Improvement","Parsing|Scripting",5,"Scope parser should report syntax errors","ScopeParser should collect error recovery and syntax error messages during parsing. These items should then be emitted to the log as errors. We may want to consider them warnings if the parser was able to recover. For example, we currently get no messaging when parsing ""-Console-"". Most likely, the last ""-"" is being dropped (one of Beaver's recovery strategies) and is being parsed as ""-Console"". We should at least get a warning in this case."

"APSTUD-4661","Bug","Performance",8,"Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling Can't be Turned off (reappears after restart)","I've just upgraded to the latest aptana release (3.1.1.201204131931) and immediately hitting cpu usage issues with the CPU jumping to 90%ish every few seconds corresponding to a refresh of the workspace every few seconds. So I guess on my system Aptana the option 'Refresh using Native hooks or polling' is polling rather than hooks as it happens regardless of whether or not I'm doing anything.    I've traced it down to the 'Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling' which is under the Workspace menu. If I turn it off, the system quietens down and all is fine.     However, on a restart, this 'option' has reselected itself meaning (I guess) that the option is not reading it's setting correctly from the options saved (or perhaps isn't getting saved to the file?)    So the bug I'm reporting here is the preference can't be set beyond a restart and, of course, like all preferences it should be.    A second bug I guess is quite why the refresh of the workspace uses so much CPU - my system has 8000 files on a fairly old machine so I'm guessing it's hitting limits on my machine (results will of course vary on other machines). I've commented on that before (in the forums) and it was all fine in version 3 until now. I'll repeat my guess that there is a very inefficient method involved in the refresh of the workspace that still hasn't been resolved.     Anyway - hopefully to replicate ...    Type Workspace in to the preferences and select Workspaces at the bottom to get the ""Refresh ... "" option. Unselect it. Restart the studio, go back to that preference and you'll (hopefully) see it selected again.    I've attached two images - the first when I deselected the option. The second when I restarted showing the option has been selected again."

Doesn't Type where I place cursor.",">> This bit below is copied from another issue because its the exact same issue im having i didn't feel i needed to write it again. Using build: 3.1.1.201204131931    This is a really sporadic bug that happens now and then. I have attached a video which displays the problem.    Basically, the text in the editor jumps around and I don't know which line its actually on. Its a bit like a magic show and makes the editor unusable and I haven't been able to work out a fix. I've hoped after several version releases it will go away but its persisted so here is my bug report.    I hope you can shed some light. See the attached video for the buggy demonstration.    >> Link to older issue here: https://aptanastudio.tenderapp.com/discussions/problems/2646-aptana-editor-bug-text-jumps-around-doesnt-type-where-i-place-cursor"
