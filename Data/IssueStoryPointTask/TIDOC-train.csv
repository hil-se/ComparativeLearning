These changes will be applied automatically the first time you build a project after updating to 1.4.0. However, because that first build will use the old plugin, there’s a small chance that it will fail. Retrying the build should resolve such issues. Or, you can manually update the plugin with the following command:     {{alloy install plugin \[path_to_project\]}}    The current directory is assumed. So if you enter that command while in your project’s folder, you can omit the path. CLI users are not affected by this change."

Issue    Users are reporting that the lists of methods/properties/events in the Titanium API reference aren't appearing.    h4. Reason  This is a result of the changes in TIDOC-1807. Although the default setting (in the code) is for all platforms to be checked, the corresponding LocalStorage data from which these settings are read isn't getting updated properly in some cases, -probably because the browser is loading a cached version of the page/script-. because the LocalStorage data that's read to determine what to filter is out of sync with new filtering logic.      The code needs to account for this and show everything if the LocalStorage platform filter settings are undefined.    h4.

The current ACS website (cloud.appcelerator.com) will be discontinued in favor of the Platform’s integrated dashboard._  * http://docs.appcelerator.com/arrowdb/latest/#!/guide/quickstart uses the word _Cloud_ a lot, potentially causing confusion by using terms like:  ** _ArrowDB Cloud_ where it could just say _ArrowDB_  ** _Platform or Cloud Services_ where it could just say _Platform Services_  * Appcelerator Studio where (see screenshot) the Appcelerator Platform Services list _Cloud_ while it really is only about ArrowDB, which is also the documentation where the (i) links to.    h3.

"TIDOC-2303","Improvement","Guides",3,"Update docs with DefaultIcon.png info","TIMOB-19477 introduced support for DefaultIcon.png. This image is used to generate missing app icons and iTunesArtwork. Currently, only iOS is supported. There are tickets (TIMOB-19485, TIMOB-19486, TIMOB-19487) to add support for DefaultIcon.png to the other platforms.    The DefaultIcon.png must be square. It should be 1024x1024, but must be at least 180x180 (60@3x). If the iTunesArtwork is missing and the DefaultIcon.png is at least 512x512, then the iTunesArtwork will be generated (same goes for @2x 1024x1024).    The DefaultIcon.png only comes into play if an app icon or iTunesArtwork is missing. Missing app icons will break the build. Missing iTunesArtwork will not.    NOTE: iTunesArtwork is only applicable to dist-adhoc builds. Older Titanium SDKs (4.x and older) copied iTunesArtwork for device and dist-appstore builds, but no more!    New Titanium apps will come with a DefaultIcon.png that is 1024x1024.    So, the major breakage is that if your app is missing an appicon, the build errors out. Existing apps won't have the DefaultIcon.png, so they will have to copy the file from a new project or create one (which they should do anyways).    The previous behavior of resizing the appicon.png or appicon@2x.png has been removed. Now appicon.png and appicon@2x.png are completely ignored."

"TIDOC-2506","Improvement","APIDoc",1,"Add more info to troubleshooting steps of ""Errors Logging In to Studio"" in documentation.","This is created on behalf of an intercom customer.     *Actual Scenario:*  I cannot log in to Appcelerator Studio (or using the appc command line utility). It keeps telling me my username/passoword are invalid, but I know they are not. I can login just fine using the same credentials on appcelerator.com.     *Cause:*    If the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to ""development"", the appc-platform-sdk module essentially assumes you are an internal developer for appcelerator and forces you to a pre-production or development environment if you have it configured.     I don't have development info configured so it was sending me to pre-prod.     I'm guessing pre-prod only has certain accounts whitelisted for login and just returns 4xx invalid login for everyone else which is why I was getting that error.    *Recommended Fixes*    1. *Use another (e.g. namespaced) environment variable*. This is only useful for your engineers internally so just namespace it to like APPC_NODE_ENV. NODE_ENV can be used by other developers and other projects for many uses (for better or for worse).    2. If you're in development mode, print this out at the top of appc commands that hit the API. If you're going to silently change how your entire module behaves for the end user, based on this common env variable, you should at least read that you're in development/preproduction mode and print this out to the user.    3. Add this to troubleshooting steps http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Errors_Logging_In_to_Studio"
