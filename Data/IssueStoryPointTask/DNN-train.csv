It seems to be that DNN&nbsp; does not allow header and footer tags to be contentpanes. For example &nbsp;&lt;footer class=""footer""&nbsp; id=""FooterPane""&nbsp; runat=""server""&gt;&lt;/footer&gt; &nbsp;Is not recognized. Does anybody have an idea why?&nbsp;  For now I included an extra div in the footer element for the content pane, but I would like the use the html 5 tags for content panes as well.     Clear Steps to Reproduce: 1- enter the following into en dnn html 5 skin 2.- &lt;footer class=""footer""&nbsp; id=""FooterPane""&nbsp; runat=""server""&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;  Actual Result: 1.

"DNN-19924","Bug","Modules - Core",1,"Console module incorrectly sorts candidate tabs","In DesktopModules/Admin/Console/ViewConsole.ascx.cs on or about line 302, the candidate tabs are sorted by level and child-status:    if ((IsHostTab()))     {     tempTabs = TabController.GetTabsBySortOrder(Null.NullInteger).OrderBy(t =&gt; t.Level).ThenBy(t =&gt; t.HasChildren).ToList();     } else     {     tempTabs = TabController.GetTabsBySortOrder(PortalId).OrderBy(t =&gt; t.Level).ThenBy(t =&gt; t.HasChildren).ToList();     }    This change was introduced in changeset 61158.   This modification was erroneous, and causes incorrect results when the console module is applied against a multi-level page hierarchy.   Specifically, the subsequent loop assumes an ordering of the following form:   Tab Level 1 Sort 1 Tab Level 1 Sort 2     Tab Level 2 Sort 1     Tab Level 2 Sort 2 Tab Level 1 Sort 3     Tab Level 2 Sort 1         Tab Level 3 Sort 1   However, the ordering identified above does not perform this sorting.  If the GetTabsBySortOrder call does not return an ordering with recursive grouping (I&apos;m not sure whether it does), additional work will need to be performed to achieve the desired ordering.   At a minimum, the modification should be removed to read:     if ((IsHostTab()))     tempTabs = TabController.GetTabsBySortOrder(Null.NullInteger); else     tempTabs = TabController.GetTabsBySortOrder(PortalId);     (Extraneous brackets removed due to lame-ness.)

It would be nice to print out a comment that tells which file is which. Perhaps this should be a configurable option as well?   The composite file provider in CDF currently does        if (type == ClientDependencyType.Javascript)     {      sw.Write("";;;""); //write semicolons in case the js isn&apos;t formatted correctly.

"DNN-20333","Bug","Core API",1,"Error inside ModuleSettingsPresenterBase","Brief Description of Issue:   The constructor of ModuleSettingsPresenterBase&lt;TView&gt; does not instantiate dictionaries for TabModuleSettings and ModuleSettings in its constructor. Subsequently, Presenters inheriting from ModuleSettingsPresenterBase&lt;TView&gt; will have to instantiate these two dictionaries inside their constructors or else a Null Reference Exception will be thrown when trying to access them. This is especially galling because the method LoadFromContext() of ModuleSettingsPresenterBase&lt;TView&gt; will try to add settings to these two dictionaries. It does so if setting keys are present inside ModuleContext.Configuration.ModuleSettings and .TabModuleSettings.

"DNN-21235","Bug","Core API",5,"SI: add setting for SMTP client for idletime and connectionlimit","the .NET SMTP client does not have a close or dispose method, so it keeps its connection open to the SMTP server it is connected to. This is an issue that was raised with Microsoft here: http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/337557/smtpclient-does-not-close-session-after-sending-message   As a workaround the .NET team makes this suggestion:    The SmtpClient class currently does not have a Close() or Dispose() method. However, you can change the default idle timeout of the ServicePoint so that the connection is dropped after each email is sent.  For example:  Smtp client = new SmtpClient(""hostname""); client.ServicePoint.MaxIdleTime = 0; client.ServicePoint.ConnectionLimit = 1; ... client.Send(new MailMessage(...));  // at this point, the connection will get closed  // since the ServicePoint idle time is now 0.

I can post a backup of the environment should you not be able to reproduce this issue again.   I used EE for this, but this feature should be the same across all editions.   I marked this as ""Minor"" but this looks horrible in our sales demos to prospective customers.   Clear Steps to Reproduce:      Clean install of 06.02.00     Upgrade incrementally to 06.02.02     Populate the Portals directory with several files of various types (can be done prior to upgrade too)     Ensure that at least one of those files is a HTML template file     Login with any user that can edit content (I used a Host user)     Edit content in a HTML module     Choose the Template Manager in the editor  Actual Result:      All files are shown as being available, regardless to file type  Expected Result:       Only files ending in .htmtemplate should be shown  Here is a link to my demo environment:  http://dnn-sales.s3.amazonaws.com/Demo/Demo%20Sites/DNNEE-AwesomeCycles-SalesDemo-201208200925.zip"

Currently, the DNN 7 installer still honors the "".dnn6"" extension, but not a .dnn7 extension.   I opened up the Source for DNN and found there were two places this needed to be changed.

I&apos;ve attached the two effected files, which are found in the DNN source code package here:  /Community/Library/Services/Installer   All that&apos;s need is an extra Case in the Case statement on line 464 of InstallFile.cs and and additional if statement on line 389 in InstallerInfo.cs.

"DNN-24342","New Feature","Skins - DotNetNuke",2,"Hide Command Bar Querystring Parameter","On some modules, it can be helpful for developers to be able to hide the command bar. In DNN6 this could be done using a special skin, but, in 7, the command bar is injected at the top of the page and so the skin approach doesn&apos;t work.   The procedure that injects the command bar is in Skin.cs. Before doing so, it evaluates two querystring parameters - popup and dnnprintmode. Both of those hide the command bar, but, both also do other things.    I think we should add a third parameter - hidecommandbar. Then, this could be used by developers to hide the command bar - even in admin mode - when needed. Because it&apos;s just a querystring parameter, and that&apos;s all it does, this should be a very simple addition. Here is the revised code:           private void InjectControlPanel() { //if querystring dnnprintmode=true, controlpanel will not be shown if (Request.QueryString[""dnnprintmode""] != ""true"" &amp;&amp; Request.QueryString[""popUp""] != ""true"" &amp;&amp; Request.QueryString[""hidecommandbar""] != ""true"") { //ControlPanel processing var objControlPanel = ControlUtilities.LoadControl&lt;ControlPanelBase&gt;(this, Host.ControlPanel);"

"DNN-2964","Bug","Admin - User Accounts",5,"Cannot Allow Non-Admins to Manage Users","Brief Description of Issue: In DNN 7, we have broken the ability for Admins to be able to allow non-admins to manage users on their site.  This is a very common use case where organizations would typically allow lower level person(s) or certain managers the ability to manage users.  This is an especially common use case among social websites where community managers will need to field user account issues, but do not need or should not have administrator privileges.. We have broken this capability in DNN 7.  No longer can you give non-admins access to the User Accounts page and allow them to manage users.  You cannot even allow this when putting the module on a non-admin page.  You can still get to manage the user&apos;s security roles, but you cannot create new users or edit existing users. Since I personally know of numerous sites that do this in 6.x and am even talking to customers regularly that want to do this, I have given this a higher priority and severity.  I hope that we can get this fixed sooner than later.  :)   Clear Steps to Reproduce:      Clean install of any edition of DNN 7.0.0     Create a new user      Create a security role for the new user     Allow the security role to have View permission to the User Accounts page     Give the security role permission to edit the module or full control     ...

User can choose to completely hide the treeview pane or show it in its standard width. But there is no way to adjust to width of this pane. A scrollbar appears on the bottom, using which the user can scroll to a folder that is buried deep into the subfolders, but this is still very painful to use. I can imagine how difficult this will be when the folder structure is at an enterprise level. As far as I can remember, I have always hated to scroll horizontally. User gets&nbsp;claustrophobic&nbsp;after a few minutes of using the folder treeview.  Proposed enhancement:&nbsp;&nbsp;  When the treeview pane is visible, the user should be able to adjust the width. On the border, the icon should change to a double-sided arrow in order for the user to drag it.&nbsp; When the treeview pane is not visible, the user should NOT be able to adjust the width. When adjusting the width, the user should NOT be able to reduce the width. When adjusting the width, the user should be able to increase the width to a MAX of double the standard width (no more). When the toggle button is clicked, the treeview hides completely no matter what the current width of the treeview was. For every change in width, the horizontal scrollbar should adjust accordingly. Nice to have: The width of the ""Name"" column on the main gridview should adjust according to the changing width of the treeview panel as the user adjusts the panel widths. The width of all other columns on the gridview stays the same. Now, we are talking! Horizontal Scrollbar still exists just in case the folder structure is really deep.&nbsp;"

"DNN-26810","Improvement","Templates",3,"Save / Restore Module with Settings + Content","Problem: Often modules have more content in the ""settings"" than in ""content"". I have for example an HTML module with a lot of javascript in the head section of the settings and only one simple canvas element in the content. Exporting content only exports the canvas and nothing else. Solution: DNN has internal methods for saving a complete page or even a complete website as a template, with all settings. But when exporting and importing module content, these methods are not used. Instead there is a special solution for this which only fetches the content and nothing else. Attachment: I attached 3 changed files of the core which changes this behaviour to the standard DNN way and allows to export and import a module with all the settings. There are only minor changes in codebehind of export.ascx and import.ascx and 1 new method in ModuleController.cs. If an old template is selected for import, import goes the old way and a new template imports the whole thing with settings and permissions Enhancements: I did not change the UI of import.ascx. Perhaps it would be a great enhancement to add some checkboxes like: Include Settings, Include Content, Include Permissions. If IncludeContent is checked by default and the others not this is the behaviour like before. You could easy add these values as parameters to the new Method in ModuleController and add some ""if""-statements."

And if we allow null banner type, then BannerTypeId must be ignored and PortalSettings used instead. int BannerType = 0; if (AllowNullBannerType) {&nbsp; // shoud be: if (!AllowNullBannerType) &nbsp;&nbsp; if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(BannerTypeId) { &nbsp;&nbsp; ...

I've added a radio button list to the SiteSettings control which will ask the user if they want the default host smtp, or the new portal based settings. The modifications next go into the Library\Entities\Host\Host.vb file, and check if the current portal has these settings specified, if they do it will return the portal settings and not the host settings. This should account for every custom module that uses SMTP without any breaking changes. No modifications were necessary in the Mail class.     The only bugs I can think might show up, is if the current portal has portal smtp enabled and you go into host to check the host smtp it will probably return the portals settings, you'll need to goto the configured HostPortalId to view the host smtp settings in this case.    ---    The Google Analytics is another feature I've used for ages, I didn't feel like removing the 6 lines of code this adds into the core before submitting the files... feel free to remove if don't want to include it...

However, there is a list of settings within the FriendlyUrlSettings constructor which do not conform to this design.   These should be changed to the AUM_ standard to match the other settings.    The list of settings which should be renamed are:    redirectDefaultPage -> AUM_RedirectDefaultPage  sslClientRedirect -> AUM_SSLClientRedirect  illegalChars -> AUM_IllegalChars  replaceDoubleChars -> AUM_ReplaceDoubleChars  regex404 -> AUM_Regex404  url404 -> AUM_Url404  url500 ->AUM_Url500  useBaseFriendlyUrls -> AUM_UseBaseFriendlyUrls  internalAliases -> AUM_INternalAliases  processRequests -> AUM_ProcessRequests  cacheTime -> AUM_CacheTime    This must be completed by creating constant declarations for these in the FriendlyUrlSettings.cs file, as well as updating the references to the string constant in the FriendlyUrlSettings constructor.    In case there is any existing settings created in sites being upgraded, these following scripts should be added to the update procedure:    update {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier}PortalSettings  set SettingName = 'AUM_' + Upper(substring(settingName,1,1)) + substring(settingName, 2, datalength(settingName))  where SettingName in ('redirectDefaultPage','sslClientRedirect', 'illegalChars', 'replaceDoubleChars', 'regex404','url404','url500','useBaseFriendlyUrls','internalAliases','processRequests','cacheTime')    update {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier}HostSettings  set SettingName = 'AUM_' + Upper(substring(settingName,1,1)) + substring(settingName, 2, datalength(settingName))  where SettingName in ('redirectDefaultPage','sslClientRedirect', 'illegalChars', 'replaceDoubleChars', 'regex404','url404','url500','useBaseFriendlyUrls','internalAliases','processRequests','cacheTime')      Note : there isn't really any test case or test that can be done with this change."

"DNN-3371","Story","Search",8,"Search > Journal Crawler (mini spike)","Currently the Site Crawler in the Platform does not crawl Journal items. Journal integration with Search is a bit tricky as Journal has a different permission system as compared with module / tab permissions. There are two ways this integration can be done:    *Treat Journal as Module and implement ModuleSearchBase*    1) The advantage of this approach is that all you need to implement is ModuleSearchBase and the content will start to get indexed by Site Crawler.  2) However, there is a downside that Journal has a different permission system then typical module / tab permission. During indexing, one would need to translate Journal’s permission into module type permission so Search can do security trimming.    *New Crawler - Create a new SearchType for Journal*    1) This approach allows checking of Journal permission at querying time.  2) This SearchType should implement BaseResultController, especially the HasViewPermission method. GetDocUrl method in this method is marked as abstract, but isn't called if Url is already stored in the SearchDocument.  3) There is no need to create a separate scheduled tasked. All we need to do is modify Site Crawler to call into Journal to obtain SearchDocuments. Site Crawler currently crawls through tab and module metadata and collects SearchDocuments from modules that implement ISearchable or ModuleSearchBase.   4) When user performs a query and hits are found in Journal, system will call HasViewPermission method every hit in Lucene. This will require a DB hit to check permission, which is a down-side.   5) Make sure the SearchType is not marked as Private.  In reality 90% of Journal entries are Public (except for ones in a Social Group), a mixed approach can be done, where permission is stored in the Index for all the public items so there isn’t a hit.    *Due to the above I call this as a mini-spike*  "

Email from Customer - The image manager has a function that sets the width and height of an image in the following control:    /Providers/HTMLEditorProviders/Telerik/Dialogs/SetImageProperties.ascx    The function attempts to get that information from one of the following sources - in order:      1) Client style    2) Image attributes    3) Client size    The function grabs the first available data and moves on.    In our skin.css, I had placed a global style to assist images to be more responsive:    img { max-width: 100% !important; height: auto !important; }    This value was apparently picked up by the function and caused the algorithm to convert it to a ""1""  When I commented this value in skin.css, the function worked as expected.  When I un-commented the value, the function broke again.    So I adjusted the css to hide that value from the admin template and the image manager is happy again."

Here is how I fixed it:            public int ProfileUserId          {              get              {                  var userId = Null.NullInteger;                  if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.Params[""UserId""]))                  {                      // Original below                      //userId = Int32.Parse(Request.Params[""UserId""]);                      // *** FIX START ***                      // Fixed as the original could lead to an exception when the                       // request string is not a number (int32)                      if (!Int32.TryParse(Request.Params[""UserId""], out userId))                          userId = Null.NullInteger;                      // *** FIX END ***                                        }                  return userId;              }          }    As the original line ("" userId = Int32.Parse(Request.Params[""UserId""]); "") could always result in an exception causing a page not to load, I would suggest to alter this to the provided code above."

"DNN-3754","Bug","Login/Registration",1,"SI: Redirect after registration not working","Description - Customer has provided us with a bug that they found. Customers email following:    The logic in the if...else code block that checks if a Redirect_AfterRegistration page was set in Portal Settings, and sets the RedirectURL accordingly, is backwards. If a redirect page was set, the value of the    ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"" portal setting returned is a positive integer value corresponding to the TabID of the page the new user should be redirected to after registration. If no page was set, or if the Administrator manually selects    ""<None Specified>"" for this setting, then the value returned is -1. Therefore, the logic in this code block (as currently shipped in version 7.1.1) is backwards and results in new users being redirected incorrectly after registering on    the site.    When the logic checks if the setting is > 0, it should redirect to the URL of the TabID set for the after registration page. Otherwise, if a positive value was not returned (ie. no redirect after registration page was set), it should    then begin the code block to check for the returnurl parameter value (if sent in querystring), or remain on the same page if no returnurl parameter value was specified. The current code's logic blocks need flip flopped to work as    designed.    STEPS TO REPRODUCE:    1. In Site Settings > User Account Settings > Registration Settings, set the User Registration type to ""Public"", Registration Form Type to ""Standard"", and set Redirect After Registration dropdown to any page (except the Home or Getting    Started pages) that is viewable by Registered Users. Be sure to Save settings.  2. If it is not already set, temporarily set View permissions on the Getting Started page to allow viewing by Registered Users.  3. Logout.  4. Navigate to registration page with a manually set ""returnurl"" parameter value in the querystring that would return you to the Getting Started page, as such: /?ctl=register&returnurl=%2fGettingStarted.aspx  5. Fill out the registration form as a new user and click ""Register"".  6. Note that instead of being redirected to the page you selected in the Redirect After Registration settings dropdown (which is where you should have been redirected to), you are redirected to the Getting Started page, which was passed    as the returnurl parameter value in querystring.    (NOTE: If you do not select a page for Redirect After Registration in the Site Settings, then you are always redirected to 404 or Home page (relative url path = ""/"") regardless of value for returnurl parameter. The reversed logic sees    that the value is not > 0, so in the else, it tries to redirect you to page with ID of the returned setting value (which in the case where none was set, the returned value is -1). There is no page found with ID = -1 when NavigateURL    tries to resolve it.)    CURRENT CODE (BUG is found in Lines 138-166 of \DesktopModules\Admin\Security\Register.ascx.cs):      protected string RedirectURL  {  get  {  string _RedirectURL = """";    object setting = GetSetting(PortalId, ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"");    if (Convert.ToInt32(setting) > 0)  {  if (Request.QueryString[""returnurl""] != null)  {  //return to the url passed to register  _RedirectURL = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(Request.QueryString[""returnurl""]);  //redirect url should never contain a protocol ( if it does, it is likely a cross-site request forgery attempt )  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""://""))  {  _RedirectURL = """";  }  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""?returnurl""))  {  string baseURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(0, _RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal));  string returnURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(_RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal) + 11);    _RedirectURL = string.Concat(baseURL, ""?returnurl"", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(returnURL));  }  }  if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(_RedirectURL))  {  //redirect to current page  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL();  }  }  else //redirect to after registration page  {  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL(Convert.ToInt32(setting));  }  return _RedirectURL;  }  }    CODE FIX (Reversing the conditional logic Code Blocks resolves this bug and the New User is redirected correctly after registering.):      protected string RedirectURL  {  get  {  string _RedirectURL = """";    object setting = GetSetting(PortalId, ""Redirect_AfterRegistration"");    if (Convert.ToInt32(setting) > 0) //redirect to after registration page  {  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL(Convert.ToInt32(setting));  }  else  {  if (Request.QueryString[""returnurl""] != null)  {  //return to the url passed to register  _RedirectURL = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(Request.QueryString[""returnurl""]);  //redirect url should never contain a protocol ( if it does, it is likely a cross-site request forgery attempt )  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""://""))  {  _RedirectURL = """";  }  if (_RedirectURL.Contains(""?returnurl""))  {  string baseURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(0, _RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal));  string returnURL = _RedirectURL.Substring(_RedirectURL.IndexOf(""?returnurl"", StringComparison.Ordinal) + 11);    _RedirectURL = string.Concat(baseURL, ""?returnurl"", HttpUtility.UrlEncode(returnURL));  }  }  if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(_RedirectURL))  {  //redirect to current page  _RedirectURL = Globals.NavigateURL();  }    }  return _RedirectURL;  }  }"

"DNN-3937","Bug","Installation",2,"Config component in manifest throws errors when XML Merge script is in separate file","According to http://www.dnnsoftware.com/wiki/Page/Manifest-Component-Installers-The-Config-Component, the Config component within a manifest should support specifying the XML Merge transformations in a separate file, rather than embedding them directly into the manifest.  This would look something like this:      However, there is a null reference exception that occurs when the {{ConfigInstaller}} tries to commit the change.  This is because the installer is trying to reference {{TargetFile.FullName}}, but {{TargetFile}} is only set when the {{fileName}} attribute _isn't_ set on the component.    The simple fix would be to check whether {{TargetFile}} is {{null}}.  But this overlooks the bigger issue, which is that when the XML Merge script is in a different file, the changes in it are applied directly to the target file (e.g. web.config).  This is in contrast to when the XML Merge script is included inline (and to components of other types) which apply changes to temporary files and then commit once the changes are verified as successful.    So, in this case where the installation fails because of the null reference exception, those XML Merge changes to the web.config are still applied to the site, and not rolled back, because they took place against the site's web.config already, before the Commit stage."

"DNN-4029","Bug","General",1,"SI: UsersOnline throwing caching exception","UsersOnline is throwing a caching exception, which was explained by Bruce as follows:    It literally means that a collection was changed (items added, removed or collection cleared) while another thread was doing an enumeration on the object.  The collection is no longer in the state expected during the enumeration process and so the exception is thrown.    However, why this is….  It could either be a bug in that a collection is being accessed by multiple threads without a thread lock (all generic collections in c# are not thread safe and require locking to be implemented by the developer) – or it could be something else within the caching provider.    The first place to look is in the UserOnlineController.SetUserList function – when and where this is called and if it could lead to a thread unsafe operation.    exception:    2013-10-31 02:30:00,567 [RD00155D4440AF][Thread:65][FATAL] DotNetNuke.Web.Common.Internal.DotNetNukeHttpApplication - System.InvalidOperationException: Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.     at System.Collections.Hashtable.GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.WriteObjectInfo.InitSerialize(Object obj, ISurrogateSelector surrogateSelector, StreamingContext context, SerObjectInfoInit serObjectInfoInit, IFormatterConverter converter, ObjectWriter objectWriter, SerializationBinder binder)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.WriteObjectInfo.Serialize(Object obj, ISurrogateSelector surrogateSelector, StreamingContext context, SerObjectInfoInit serObjectInfoInit, IFormatterConverter converter, ObjectWriter objectWriter, SerializationBinder binder)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.ObjectWriter.Serialize(Object graph, Header[] inHeaders, __BinaryWriter serWriter, Boolean fCheck)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter.Serialize(Stream serializationStream, Object graph, Header[] headers, Boolean fCheck)     at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter.Serialize(Stream serializationStream, Object graph, Header[] headers)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCacheObjectSerializationProvider.SerializeUserObject(Object userObject, Boolean isCompressionEnabled, ValueFlagsVersion flagsType)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.SocketClientProtocol.Upsert(VelocityPacketType type, String key, Object value, DataCacheItemVersion oldVersion, TimeSpan timeout, DataCacheTag[] tags, String region, IMonitoringListener listener)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.SocketClientProtocol.Put(String key, Object value, DataCacheItemVersion oldVersion, TimeSpan timeout, DataCacheTag[] tags, String region, IMonitoringListener listener)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCache.InternalPut(String key, Object value, DataCacheItemVersion oldVersion, TimeSpan timeout, DataCacheTag[] tags, String region, IMonitoringListener listener)     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCache.<>c__DisplayClass4a.<Put>b__49()     at Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.DataCache.Put(String key, Object value, TimeSpan timeout, IEnumerable`1 tags, String region)     at DotNetNuke.Providers.CachingProviders.AzureCachingProvider.AzureCachingProvider.Put(String cacheKey, Object itemToCache, DateTime absoluteExpiration, TimeSpan slidingExpiration)     at DotNetNuke.Providers.CachingProviders.AzureCachingProvider.AzureCachingProvider.Insert(String cacheKey, Object itemToCache, DNNCacheDependency dependency, DateTime absoluteExpiration, TimeSpan slidingExpiration, CacheItemPriority priority, CacheItemRemovedCallback onRemoveCallback)     at DotNetNuke.Common.Utilities.DataCache.SetCache(String CacheKey, Object objObject, DNNCacheDependency objDependency, DateTime AbsoluteExpiration, TimeSpan SlidingExpiration, CacheItemPriority Priority, CacheItemRemovedCallback OnRemoveCallback)     at DotNetNuke.Entities.Users.UserOnlineController.SetUserList(Hashtable userList)     at DotNetNuke.Entities.Users.UserOnlineController.TrackAuthenticatedUser(HttpContext context)     at System.Web.HttpApplication.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute()     at System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep step, Boolean& completedSynchronously)  "

(DNN version 6.2.5). The problem did not manifest itself on our single core test-environment, nor in our development environments. There also seemed to be no relation between any particular request and the probability of the problem occurring.    I made dumps using DebugDiag and the (32 bit version of) taskmanager. Analyses of the dumps with WinDbg  showed all of the runaway threads busy with an Insert call on a generic dictionary in the UserController.GetCachedUser method.    This method indeed gets a dictionary from the cache and sets a value on it. The dictionary is a common generic dictionary, not thread-safe. However the object is shared among threads through the cache, and thus a thread-safe dictionary should be used.    I have fixed this by changing line 242 in method UserController.GetUserLookupDictionary so that the CBO.GetCachedObject overload with the saveInDictionary parameter is used, having set the saveInDictionary  parameter to true.    I have attached the fixed version of UserController.cs. See lines 242-251    This bug probably also affects all 7+ versions and earlier 6.. versions. because the offending methods have not been changed.    So far, the high CPU problem has not returned in the past 24 hours. Before the fix, the problem would manifest itself one or more times per hour. The fix does not seam to have had any adverse effects on performance or otherwise."

"DNN-4664","Improvement","Modules - Third party|URL ReWriter",8,"Allow 404 Exception Bubbling from Modules","This item relates to the ability for a third-party module to raise a 404 and have the standard DNN 404 handler catch and handle it.    The DNN 404 handler does the following things:  1) logs the 404 to a special 404 exception type  2) shows the portal-specific 404 page  3) sends back a 'true' 404 status code, instead of the asp.net standard of generating a 302 redirect to an error page.    When module developers wish to intentionally throw a 404 error in their code (such as when a wrong-for-the-module URL is requested, such as a non-existent blog post), they cannot currently get the DNN 404 handler to deal with this.  This is because the general-exception handling catches any raised 404 exception, and turns it over to the general exception handling behaviour, which is to show an error page.    The requirements for this change are to:  1) Allow a module developer to raise a 404 exception in their module code  2) Have an unhandled 404 exception bubble up until it is in the main DNN Exception handling code (for the page lifecycle)  3) Have 404 exceptions passed-through as a special case to the URL Rewriting 404 Handling code, so that it will return a 404 status code and show the portal-specific 404 page.    Test Case  -------------  For the test case, a module will have to be built which has a simple way of generating a 404.  This is suggested to be a simple module with a view control that returns a 404 if you reuqest a set URL (ie /status/404) for the page the module exists on.  This module should be built as part of making the change and provided to the QA team.   The module should also have a way of generating a 'generic' 500 exception, to show that the normal exception handling is not affected (ie /status/500)    Step 1 : Verify that 404 handling is working as expected (example.com/junkurl)  Step 2 : Install the exception-testing module  Step 3 : Request a 404 Exception    -Expected Result-  Shows the same 404 page as Step 1    Step 4: Request a 500 Exception  -Expected Result-  Shows the DNN error page, and not the 404 page."
"DNN-4663","Bug","Skins - DotNetNuke",1,"Sub-sub menus not accessible in default skin","Sub-sub pages in ddr menu are not clickable in the standard DotNetNuke gravity skin because the sub-sub-menu-item is too far from the sub-menu-item to reach it without loosing focus on the parent item, so the sub-sub-item disappears before reaching it (see attached screenshot).    This problem is caused by this rule in the skin.css  .nav-collapse:not(.in) .nav .dropdown-menu{          border-radius:0!important;          top:37px!important;      }    Removing top:27px!important; resolves this issue.

Here is a link to the github diff that shows the fix. https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSMin/commit/55809e6d07be4a0d3029d48112d16ef833e55cf7    The version of JSMin.cs (DNN Platform/Components/ClientDependency/Source/CompositeFiles/JSMin.cs) in DNN has a date stamp of 5/22/2007 and the date stamp of this fix is 1/22/2011.

As part of this work jquery-migrate was no longer registered for a default anonymous page viewer as it was not needed - however post 7.3.0's release it became apparent that some skin and module developers were relying on jquery-migrate being registered (rather than registering it within their skin/module). Whilst this is easily fixed by adding the relevant registration (or using the jquery skin object), we decided to add a registration for jquery-migrate to help with sites running skins/modules that relied on this dependency (i.e. existing users would not need to get updated versions of their components).

"DNN-5613","Bug","Core API",2,"SI: Problem with Module Controller and 17k value","Customer has reported a bug that is present in the Core DNN API which affects the module settings table when a character of size 17k is added to the column SettingValue.    From Customer:     Here is a screencast of the bug happening and being debugged in DNN's code:  http://screencast.com/t/PcaQrv6W  We've investigated this method (UpdateModuleSettingInternal) further and we have found what is the problem.  ModuleController.cs line 685  The method uses a datareader in order to determine if a setting already exists in the ModuleSettings table and add or update the setting as it is appropriate. This is a VERY bad idea, DataReaders keep their connection with the tables they use open while they themselves are not closed, at least partially. You can imagine that trying to update a table that is being kept open milliseconds before can eventually result in a deadlock. That is what is happening in this case.  When the datareader reads the 17Kb Lorem ipsum that was already uploaded to ModuleSettings, the table gets locked, so when the code gets to ""dataProvider.UpdateModuleSetting(moduleId, settingName, settingValue, UserController.Instance.GetCurrentUserInfo().UserID);"" and calls the SP that updates ModuleSettings, the SP hangs when trying to update the table.  Since the data we where modifying in the table was already there, we commented in UpdateModuleSettingInternal all that had to do with the datareader and AddModuleSetting. This made the code work flawlessly every time instead of hanging every time.  Possible solution for this: My approach would be something like removing the datareader, and instead checking for an existing row at stored procedure level. The ""If exists"" statement has a better performance and has the perk of not locking the table after it has run. Then, in case the row exists, insert or update as needed.  Of course, this is just a suggestion, but bear in mind that since the column SettingValue is nvarchar(max), large values are not beyond the scope of what could happen (and we have proved it happened in one of our clients).  We just wanted to let you know of the problem and a possible fix. Let me know if I can be of any futher help with this issue.      Please see attached ticket for more details on this issue.      "

The enhancement proposal is to add a flag to the NotificationType table, to specify if the notification should be displayed in the task list:  - The logic in Social_cmx_GetTasks SPROC will be simplified  - The default value should be false (each notification type needs to be updated in Content/Social to set this to true; taking into consideration upgrades vs. new installations)  - This column, IsTask, should be created via the Platform as a bit column and have all values set to 0 (false) then add a constraint for NOT NULL.   - The API that exists today (for creating notification types) should create an overload method passing a default value of 0 (and also mark existing method as obsolete; only required if the method today is parameterized)    Note: The solution here must work for both Content & Social.

This process consists in the following steps:  1. Get all the SearchDocuments that has not been indexed since last execution. A SearchDocument is each piece of content in DNN.  2. Delete the previous existing stored indexed version of each document (if it exists).  3. Index and store all the SearchDocuments of 1.  The step 2 is done by comparing some fields of the stored search documents with the fields of the new search document. The problem is that in this comparison the fields ""Keywords"" and the fields ""NumericKeys"" are used to compare. This is not correct, because they may change for the same document. Imagine this situation:    - A content is added to the site and it is indexed    - Afterwards, this content is edited and a new keywork is added to it    - The indexing is run again and it detects that it is a new document (has a different keyword of the already indexed one)    - A user performs a search using a word of the body of the content and he/she gets 2 results, each one for the same content.

This was a crucial step for customers managing multiple portals and multiple installations of DNN. Every time a some user controls on a few modules were updated, deployment used to take about an entire night doing most of these steps manually on all portals and all servers. While now, this can be done in minutes.    This can be done from:    * Command line. A new tool was created called *dnncmd.exe*  * TFS Build Agent. A set of custom TFS Build Agent activies were created in order to publish modules (or extensions) right after the DNN package is created on the TFS build agent.  * From code.

As part of the SPA module support HTML modules will include support for using DNN tokens. The use of tokens provides the ability to link standard HTML to server side logic.    HTML views need to be able to define the Module Action menu items associated with a specific view.  The tokens for Module Action menus should mirror the capabilities and functionality provided by the Attributes created for MVC modules to perform this same functionality.      These tokens will use a new token pattern: [Token: {propertybag}]    Token Type 1:  [JavaScript : { url: http://jquery.com/blah }]  [JavaScript : { url: http://jquery.com/blah, priority: 1 }]  [JavaScript : { path: /jquery.js, priority: 1, provider: head }]    These tokens will call the standard DnnJSInclude methods with the defined parameters.  The propertybag is a standard JSON object and includes parameter names and values which are used to call the appropriate include methods. The order of properties in the propertybag is unimportant and should not impact the ability to bind to the appropriate JSInclude methods.

"DNN-6919","Story","Data Access (DAL)",3,"Support multiple SqlDataProvider scripts for each release","DNN upgrades are based on a 3 part version number representing the platform, major and minor version numbers.  Each version component uses a 2 digit integer with a leading zero for padding (e.g. 01.02.03).  This version number uniquely identifies a release and is used as an identifier when creating database upgrade scripts.  Every release may be composed of numerous builds, any one of which might include database changes.  All database changes are included in a single script for any given version.    This approach to versioning results in difficulty supporting upgrades from Betas to RCs to final release. Also, this script versioning scheme often results in merge conflicts as numerous developers need to edit a common script file.  These merge conflicts complicate accepting community pull requests and in rolling back changes when necessary.    h2. Card  As a developer I want to create a uniquely named database script file for every Pull Request.  The system should automatically apply scripts based on the version number and order number specified in the script name.  Scripts should follow the following naming convention: {Version}.{Order}.sqldataprovider where the {Version} token uses the standard DNN version number and the {Order} token is a simple integer with no padding characters (e.g. 01.02.03.4.sqldataprovider)    h2.

Is that complete analysis necessary that early?    One reason for the initial trigger is to filter out assemblies that won't load properly as can be read in the class.   Attached is a modification where a list of such faulty assemblies is computed to a file to avoid that check on each startup, but the catalog is further parsed when parts are later composed in the code, so the performance gain is only from not throwing unnecessary exceptions, which is negligible.

When login from child site, cookies will save as local cookie and have expire date;  2.      When login from parent site, cookies will save as session cookie.    In this case, if you both open child site and parent site in different tabs in same browser, and when authentication timeout reached(in web.config, forms node, timeout default value is 60 minutes), membership will try to extend cookie, so that it will create duplicate cookie, you can verify with below steps:  1.      Change web.config, set timeout to 3, so no need wait for a long time;  2.      Open child site and login as host;  3.      Open parent site in another tab in same browser, now it should also already login;  4.      And wait for 5 minutes, then check cookies, you will see 2 cookies.    so we need notice that when create site groups, we need avoid that cookie name may shares with sites which not in site group, and IMO no need code fix for this problem, the  workaround is just close browser and open again.

The site is load balanced over 4 web servers in our test environment but the web farm is disabled.    Even with a single entry in the WebServers table however, the problem still exists.    Looking closely at Source Code, the real reason for the problem was discovered.    The problem lies here - DNN Platform\Library\Common\Initialize.cs on method InitializeApp()    When they deploy to their test environment, the first URL they call is /install/install.aspx?mode=installresources    Because this is the first page to be executed, The InitializeApp method is called and the IsUpgradeOrInstallRequest method returns true.    Crucially, because of this - the Globals.IISAppName is not set.    When the install process then attempts to send a cache clear message, this line below in the WebRequestCachingProvider throws the exception as discussed.    var thisServer = ServerController.GetServers().Single(s => s.ServerName == Globals.ServerName && s.IISAppName == Globals.IISAppName);    They have made a change in our version of the initialize method to always set the Globals.IISAppName and this has resolved the issue for them.    Their other environments work fine because they have health monitors making requests to the home page of servers every 10 seconds.

When developing a simple MVC module (the one from: http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community-blog/cid/155216/module-development-in-dnn-8-1-introduction-to-mvc-modules can be used to reproduce the problem), and trying to add it to a page more than once, nothing happens on sub subsequent module adds.

If you have 2 dummy text files in a module, let's say CleanMe1.txt and CleanMe2.txt, that are installed as part of a module's 1.0 version (revision 0) the way you would test this is build a new revision of the 1.0 module (so 1.0.0 revision 1) that says delete CleanMe1.txt and/or CleanMe2.txt as part of cleanup (this is in the manifest/dnn file). If properly declared in the manifest upgrading the existing module to 1.0.0 revision 1 should delete those files from the module's folder. "
