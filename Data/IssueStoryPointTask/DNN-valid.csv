Card  As a content manager, I want to be able to set the content type, view template and edit templates for a specific instance of the DCC viewer module.    h2. Conversation  The Content Type drop down list should display all of the portal and global types available in the current portal.    The view template drop down list should display all the view templates associated with a specific content type.    The edit template drop down list should display all of the view templates associated with a specific content type.  In addition, the edit template list will include an option to use an auto-generated view. The auto-generated option will be the default option.    If there is a file that matches the following pattern then it should be the default edit view: [view template name]_edit.cshtml.  For example, if you have a view template named customer.cshtml, then file named customer_edit.cshtml will automatically be selected if it exists, otherwise the auto-generated option will be the default value.    If the current module does not have any settings configured, then the view should show an informational message at the top of the view notifying the user that they need to configure the module.    h2.

When accessing a page with permission ""Registered users"" of a multi-language portal using the second language (that is different from the default one), the user is redirected to the home page of the default language instead of the login page of the current language.    Steps to reproduce the issue.  1: Install a DNN 7.4.2. blank website in English (United States).  2: Add a second language (ie. it-IT).  3: Enable ""Allow Content Localization"" in Host > Host settings > Other settings.  4: In Admin > Languages press button ""Enable Localized Content"".

Add ""Account login"" module to this page. Set page permission to ""All users"" for this page.   10: In second language, copy ""Account login"" module, translate and publish the Login page.  11: Set the Login page for both languages in Admin > Site settings > Advanced settings.  12: In English - United State language, add a new page (ie.

Card  One DNN 7 ""feature"" that I think needs to be added to items for DNN 8 cleanup is the removal of the Advanced Settings screen.

It didn't remove options, but instead duplicated options that were already available.    !AdvancedConfigurationSettings.png!    h2. Conversation  Often the way this was implemented was by re-using existing user controls in the new Advanced Settings screen.  This approach is blocking the team's ability to separate out the Skins module since one of the user controls in the skins module is also used in the advanced settings page. See DNN-6637.    h2.

"DNN-8141","Story","JWT",3,"Implement Moniker API for Service Framework ","A moniker is a simple name provided for an objects that simplifies identifying specific object instances.  This concept was first used in Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and the Component Object Model (COM).      The DNN Services Framework was first introduced in DNN 6.2.  When creating web services with the Service Framework, it is common to require callers to provide the ModuleId and TabId as part of the web request header.  This requirement complicates the programming model since service endpoints become tied to their specific location in a website.  Modules are able to easily retrieve the ModuleId and TabId from the service framework as part of the initial module rendering.  However, this mechanism is not available for remote callers, where the UI rendering is not directly controlled by DNN.    In order to encapsulate this context data and to simplify the programming model for web services, we should introduce the concept of a moniker.  The DNN service moniker will provide a mechanism for mapping a simple name to a specific module instance.  This moniker can then be passed to a web service in place of the ModuleId, TabId or any other context data specific to a module.    The moniker should be implemented as an additional system TabModule setting. By default, the moniker will be composed of the page name, the module definition friendly name and the TabModuleId separated by /.  When composing the default moniker, all spaces should be replaced with dashes.  For example, if the Social Groups module was on the “Community” page with TabModuleId of 100, the default moniker would be “Community/Social-Groups/100”.      The default moniker implementation provides a human friendly method to identify the page and module being addressed and also a unique element to differentiate between multiple modules on the same page.  The core platform should expose a service endpoint that allows an application to query for monikers related to a specific module type that the current user has permissions to view.    When calling service endpoints that need a specific module context, the moniker will be included as part of the service call.  The service can then use the moniker to easily lookup any context for the module instance associated with the moniker.    *Developer Notes:*  The purpose of this step is to help the back-end to create the DNN context for the web API request. Therefore, it is not tied to any authentication mechanism (like JWT, Basic, Forms, etc.)    Injecting the moniker in the query part of the API request requires modifying all existing API’s that need to use this moniker  but is not feasible and requires making changes to existing core (which we want to completely avoid). What we need is a non-invasive method. One way in which this can be implemented is by adding a new vendor specific header in the request as an alternate way to using the {{TabID}} and {{ModuleID}} that are in use today. Assume we are going to use {{X-DNN-MONIKER}} for this purpose. An example of a full header would be:  {{X-DNN-MONIKER: John’s Blog}}    Before being able to use this feature, there is a need for an API that returns the various monikers associated with a specific module. Let’s say in an EVOQ Engage site if we need to find all the monikers that use the discussions module, say discussions (i.e., all tabs/pages that have the discussions module in them), we will send an API request that returns all of these monikers associated with discussion modules placed on various pages. This call may return zero, one, or more monikers.    There must be a consideration for user rights in every data returned from the API; no private data should be revealed to an un-authorized user."

BUT there is a solution: if we deploy the built PDB files from visual studio together with the .DLL files, then the error messages include exact line numbers. This is very helpful in fixing issues.     PDB files have no security implication, they are like JS-map files and only help the error-system inform the user about the code-line where something happened.     Because of this, it's important that we can also include the PDB files in the installation. Unfortunately as of now, the installer blocks this extension - telling the user it's unsafe.     We should add pdb-files to the list of allowed files in the assembly installer to aid in better user error-feedback.

"DNN-8552","Bug","Admin - Site Redirection Management|Login/Registration",2,"Account Login Module Redirect Issue","I have a custom module that heavily uses the ReturnUrl querystring parameter for better user flow. The site also has the DNN Account Login module placed on each page of the website for users to login. When a user is logged in, the user is immediately 302 redirected to the URL specified in the ReturnUrl parameter. This behavior breaks any module that utilizes the ReturnUrl feature of DNN.    In versions prior to DNN v8 (e.g. v7.4.2), authenticated users were not redirected when the Account login module is on a page and the URL included a ReturnUrl parameter.    I am aware that the LOGIN skin object can create the login link to open the popup window or take the user to the login page, but the Account Login module should be able to be placed on a page without affecting the flow. The RedirectUrl parameter should only be followed during an actual successful authentication, not because the page it is on just happens to have a RedirectUrl parameter.    QA need to pick up build less than 9.2.0.301 though it is present since 8.0.1, and issue is about having Account Login Module in a page for logged in user, if on such page returnurl is present then application was redirecting it to that page, which is not desirable.    +Steps to reproduce:+    1. After login as host, add two pages one with all (PageAllWithAccountModule) and other is registered users permission (restricted)  2. In edit mode, Add Account Login Module on PageAllWithAccountModule, then exit from EDIT MODE.  3. You should be on that page then your URL will be  http://yousitename/PageAllWithAccountModule  4. Now add returnurl in the above URL and enter, like this http://yousitename/PageWithAccountModule?returnurl=restricted    Expected:  It should be on same page with URL, should not follow returnurl   http://yousitename/PageWithAccountModule?returnurl=restricted     Result:  It is redirecting to restricted page   http://yousitename/restricted     However if user is not logged in and he tries to access http://{yousitename}/restricted, then he would see redirected url like this  http://yousitename/Login?returnurl=%2frestricted  And upon logging in he should be redirected restricted page with URL  http://yousitename/restricted    So, in brief returnurl should only work if user is not logged in, if logged-in then not"

"DNN-9048","Bug","Messaging",1,"Compose Message Modal Dialogue Overflows Small Screens","The compose Message popup overflows screens smaller than 650px.    Two main reasons:    1.The js instantiating the dialogue is hard coded with 650px min width so it won't render well for anything much smaller.       2. There are some issues with the the dnnLabel class that also could be wrapped in a media query so that mobile devices render the compose message box well.    I believe the solution would be to alter these to files.  ComposeMessage.js, ComposeMess.css    *Steps*  # Open the website in chrome.  # Go to Messages under the Account flyout menu  # Click on Compose Message. It should show Compose message window correctly.  # Press CTRL + SHIFT + M. This should switch the chrome to mobile emulator mode. Choose any size less than 650 wide.  # Refresh the page and click on Compose message again.    *Expected*  Compose message window is shown fully in the screen  *Actual*  Compose message window is wider than the screen and therefore goes out of work space.

"DNN-9485","Bug","Login/Registration",2,"SI: maxInvalidPasswordAttempts is partially locking user","Brief Description of Issue:  User created a function that allows staff to programmatically Reset Password instead of getting locked out. However their code is not working since DNN is partially locking the user before they reach the max attempts.    *Here is their comment:*  DNN is partially locking out the borrower on the 5th attempt(default without the maxInvalidPasswordAttempts). If I set the maxInvalidPasswordAttempts to 4 it still only partially locks the user on the 4th attempt.    If you try to programmatically ResetPassword there is an exception that the user is locked out, but when you look at the account IN DNN the account does not say that it is locked out and has a strange Last Lockout Date in the Database. In addition if you programmatically look at Membership.LockedOut for that user it shows false. It’s not until the user tries the next attempt at a password and fails does it FULLY get locked out.    In your sample of changing it to 4. Try to login 4 times only with the wrong password. Then login as an admin and look at the account. It does not show as being locked out…until you update that account or they try on the 5th attempt.    *We have a function that allows our staff to programmatically ResetPassword. This fails because they are partially locked out*. In the code we check the Membership.LockedOut. If it is true then we unlock the user before the ResetPassword. If it is false we do not unlock the user. In this case it showing false so the unlock code is skipped, and the ResetPassword is attempted and gets an exception because the it says that the user is locked out. Seems to me that there is a flaw in the DNN code that sets the user as locked out or the Membership.LockedOut is showing an incorrect status(false when it should be true).    *Here is a snippet of that code:*    Dim dnnUser As Entities.Users.UserInfo = MembershipProvider.Instance.GetUserByUserName(PortalId, ltUserName.Text)    Dim aspUser As MembershipUser = System.Web.Security.Membership.Providers(""AspNetSqlMembershipProviderAdmin"").GetUser(ltUserName.Text, False)    If dnnUser.Membership.LockedOut Then    MembershipProvider.Instance.UnLockUser(dnnUser)    End If    Dim newPassword As String = aspUser.ResetPassword()    The LockedOut is False and the ResetPassword throws an exception that says it is locked out.    Again this only occurs if the user does not go beyond the maxInvalidPasswordAttempts and calls us to reset their account password."
