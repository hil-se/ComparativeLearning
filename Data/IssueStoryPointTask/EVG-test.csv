I suspect this would've blocked the commit queue until it timed out.    Can you look into whether this was an Evergreen, VPC/networking issue, Github or other issue?    Furthermore, what can be done to prevent this in the future? Should we set timeouts for the commit queue tasks in the server yaml. Does the git command support a timeout for the initial round trip connection (which I'm assuming is what failed here)?
