"TISTUD-7682","Improvement","Windows",3,"Update Windows SDK Preference Page to use Windows Publisher ID","We've had to make a change to some of the config/command line values we use for Windows SDK.    Basically before there was a Windows Phone Publisher GUID (-G) that was required. We ended up never actually using that, and it was a holdover from the Win 8 Mobile Web hybrid app stuff. Now that value and config value are optional, not required. It's used to specify the old Windows 8 publisher ID that MS assigned you, in the scenario that you're publishing an ""upgraded"" version of the app for Win 8.1/10.    There's now a ""sister"" config value/option called the WIndows Phone product id for the same upgraded 8->8.1 app scenario. It's to specify the old Win 8 app id. see https://github.com/sgtcoolguy/titanium_mobile_windows/blob/master/cli/commands/_build/config/wpProductId.js  Again that's optional. I think it's ok to not surface either of these two config/command line options because they'd be used extremely rarely by our customers. (plus one is more global - the Win 8 publisher GUID, while the other is app-specific - the Windows Phone product id).    The important change is likely to make the pref page handle showing/editing the new Windows publisher Id config value now (in place of the Windows Phone Publisher GUID we discussed above that it currently surfaces). It's defined for the CLi here: https://github.com/sgtcoolguy/titanium_mobile_windows/blob/master/cli/commands/_build/config/winPublisherId.js  It's stored in the ti CLI config key windows.publisherId, and can be specified on the comm,and line with the --win-publisher-id or -I switch. The value is assigned by MS when you sign up for a dev center account, and would be found on your Windows Dev Ceter dashboard at https://dev.windows.com/en-us/Account/Management      "

It was bit annoying while I was working with AmerisourceBergen customer while setting up the system to work on a specific issue, there were so many error reporting prompts in his case. I understand we are pushing every error to the studio log but at times this really frustrating to the customer to confirm every crash report if they choose to enable error reporting.    My recommendation is, by default let's send the error reports silently, and also show the send action type( Ask before sending or Send silently) in the default configuration dialog when the user is trying to configure error reporting for the first time, so that, user is aware of the default send action type and if he/she choose to change they can always change directly from the initial configuration page.

Moreover, this is not something that happens every run try, sometimes it requires a scoped incremental build and sometimes it just runs fine.     Our project has a size of almost 500 MB (17 MB are pictures).   Our app folder is small in size (only 21 MB), but the whole project folder is 500 MB (the large project size is due to titanium modules like ti.imagefactory and ti.googlemaps).  This issue wasn't happening before 20th of March, so I tried reverting to the last Appcelerator Studio version, but that didn't work either. Neither did, reinstalling Studio or rebooting the machine. We are currently using Titanium SDK 6.0.2 on our project, but SDK 6.0.1 and 6.0.3 are also not working the ideal way.
