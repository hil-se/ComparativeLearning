"CLI-903","Improvement","Core",13,"Investigate locking down NPM dependencies","When deploying NPM modules, even if we specify exact versions in our package.json file, those dependencies could be less strict in what they choose to use. The end result is that every install of our NPM modules could be different, leading to difficult-to-reporduce bugs.    One solution is to use tools like shrink-wrap or lockdown:    https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-shrinkwrap.html  https://www.npmjs.org/package/lockdown    Some goals:    * People can use NPM install from the NPMJS repo like before  * They only get the exact set of direct and indirect dependencies we've tested    There is a concern (as noted in APPTS-1879) that a dependency could be unpublished from NPM. It's unclear how prevalent that is, but it is a possibility.    If we instead decided to host a version of our nodules external to NPMJS, then we'd need to make sure we removed them from the main repo to avoid confusion.  "

"CLI-670","Bug","Core",0,"Proxy Server settings not carried through properly",".appcelerator/appc-cli.json is a file that is created on macs.  When users need a proxy server on a corporate network, they need to enter the proxy server in studio and the CLI.  Here are the problems I uncovered with regards to the CLI operation.     1) It looks like the values on both are different, proxy differs from proxyServer.       2) Also, not all parts of the CLI, especially when using Arrow are using the proxy server settings.  Especially on ""appc new"", ""appc login"", etc.. all need to ensure they are carrying over the proxy server settings.       3) We should allow the ability to do a ""appc config set proxyServer"" setting without having it to try to auto - update.  Otherwise, it will keep failing as it does not have the ability to work outside a network.     4) Also, some of the services like appc new are doing the up to 10 tries to try to get the source.  If it's using the wrong proxy server settings, it will lock a user out.       FINAL THOUGTS FOR RESOLUTION  - We had to edit the .appcelerator/appc-cli.json to have the right syntax to finally get it to work right.      - the titianium-connection-test -p proxy server usage seemed to be great  to work. Maybe we need to incorporate a proxy server test to make sure the syntax is right after a user enters it.     "
"CLI-679","Story","Core",8,"Build: Update, Package and Deploy the dependencies ","Unified CLI has a lot of dependencies/modules, and if a few of those modules are updated, then there is a chance that we are missing to include those updated modules in new version of appc-cli.    When we attempt to publish a new version of appc-cli, the proposal is -    - We know a list of dependencies (appc-cli-titanium, arrow, appc-platform-sdk...)  - Look for any code changes (in git) after the latest tag, or any changes after the recent version of appc-cli published date.  - For each modified dependent module,   -- Update the version  -- Publish the npm package  -- Tag a release in the specified branch (4_0_X or 4_1_X)  - Change the package.json of appc-cli with all of the modified module versions.  - Publish appc-cli.  - Tag appc-cli version in the github with the release name."
"CLI-676","Bug","Core",5,"CLI needs better support to handle proxy servers","We need better support to handle proxy servers inside the Unified CLI.  Here are some observations to make from being onsite with Comerica recently:     # if AppC Studio has already defined a proxy, can the CLI just use this setting? Studio will put a ""proxy"" server setting in the {{<HOME>/.appcelerator/appc-cli.json file}}. When you first install the CLI, there is no way to insert a proxyServer settings (it always tries to update without checking if a proxy required to get outside). The only workaround was to hack this file and all a proxyServer setting.  # When both are finally defined ( the proxy for studio + proxy for CLI ), the syntax for both seem to be different.  We had to modify to figure out which one worked.  The titanium-connection-test proxy flag seemed to work great. Maybe we can mirror some of the capability.   # We need to ensure that if the proxy is defined, then it should  follow through all the CLI commands.  Found that some commands may not have passthrough to use the proxy server if it is set.     EXPECTED RESULTS    # Provide an command or option to set the proxy server for CLI before the CLI tries to do ""appc use latest"" or run any initial commands ( as they might not work without a proxy server ).  Maybe the CLI can look for a proxy server to be set through studio and use that as well.   # CLI use the proxy server prior to running any request for external resource if the proxy server is set. "
