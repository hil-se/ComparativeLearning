Steps to reproduce  1. Create an iOS app and build for iOS device  Result: app is built and run correctly. However, in the bottom-right corner of Studio, there is an ongoing process (see Screen Shot 2014-05-28).   Expected result: Studio should show no ongoing process.    2. Click on the bottom-right progress bar  Result:  Progress window is displayed, showing details on the ongoing process (""Launching delegate"" progress information is shown).

This happens when during manual installation of Git, the option for 'Simple Context Menu' (as mentioned in latest docs as well) is chosen instead of 'Advanced Context Menu (git-cheetah plugin)'. Also the issue is only with installation of Git1.8.3 or higher.    If the manually installed Git is either Git1.8.2 or lower, or installed using Git-cheetah option, the installer does find the installed Git and hence does not try to install Git again.

Summary  As of the release of Titanium (& Studio) 3.3.0, old Android modules project had to be recreated (the structure having changed, the new build scripts wouldn't build an project created previously).

Even when imported in ADT they are pure ""text"" projects and no autocompletion or syntax validation is available anymore.    h3. How to reproduce  Having properly installed the following SDKS :   Android 4.4.2, Android 4.1.2, Android 2.3.3  And having the NDK installed and properly configured in studio.    From an empty workspace, when you create a new Android module (in the example named bob, with id com.bob), everything seems to work fine, no errors are displayed during the creation and you now get a structure where source files are in android/src/com/bob folder :    !AndroidModuleBug.png!    The Java files no longer appear as part of a *package*.  There are *no jar* dependencies shown.  It's not even a *proper Java project* anymore.    I have removed a "";"" in the screenshot to show that the *syntax validation* didn't pick it up.  When using *autocomplete*, you get the following message (cf. screenshot) ""This compilation unit is not on the build path of a Java project"".    When removing the fake syntax error, the module packages fine, however it can no longer be worked on properly : no proper Java editing, have to ""guess"" all the fields.    I have reinstalled Titanium Studio from scratch to make sure it was not related to a problem in the update mechanism.

As Studio is unable to connect/authenticate against 360 server, it gets a json feed indicating that the ""proxy authentication is required"". However, Studio still shows an error message that the ""username/password combination is incorrect"". The error message is completely misleading even though the underlying issue is due to incorrect proxy configuration. Studio should show the same error message that we receive from 360/dashboard login API."
"TISTUD-7007","Improvement","Android",5,"Redundant browse buttons exists for setting genymotion preferences in appcelerator studio","h5.Description:  1. For genymotion preferences in studio some of the browse buttons are redundant.    2. On MAC OSX:  The browse buttons for genymotion path & genymotion player are redundant as the executables are inside the app contents of the genymotion.app & we can't browse to it using the browse button.    3. On Windows:  The browse button for genymotion path is redundant as we are setting a path & not a path for an .exe file.    For more info about genymotion preferences refer : http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Installing_Genymotion    h5. Expected Result:  1. The redundant buttons should be removed or replaced with an alternative.  "
"TISTUD-7012","Story","Cloud",5,"Avoid installing Node.ACS CLI using Update wizard","In case Node.ACS CLI is not installed on the machine, then we would like to defer its installation until it is actually required. So, we should not prompt to install during the update wizard dialog either during the startup or even if the user check for updates.    However if it is already installed on the machine, then we do need to check for its updates."
"TISTUD-7011","Story","Cloud",5,"Prompt for Node.ACS CLI installation before publishing the app","In case Node.ACS CLI is not installed on the machine, and if the user tries to publish a acs app, then Studio should prompt for Node.ACS CLI installation before we publish the app."

"TISTUD-7018","Bug","Update",8,"Yosemite: Node.ACS update is not listed in Studio update wizard","When *acs* is installed through the studio update wizard, it's not listed in update components list.

"TISTUD-7032","Bug","Modules|Tiapp",5,"The default size of modules table in tiapp is reduced","After the fix for TISTUD-7018, the size of the tiapp modules table depends on the number of added modules. If there are no modules, then the size is shrinked, and if we add more than 6 modules, then it overflows.    The tiapp modules table has to set a default size (as earlier) and as number of modules in the table increases, user should be able to scroll through the list."
